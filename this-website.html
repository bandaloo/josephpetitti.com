			<h2>About</h2>
			
			<p>This website is written almost entirely in HTML and CSS. The point of this website was to help
			   teach myself web design, and make a personal website that looks good enough to show off to 
			   employers and friends. The design of the site has evolved over several weeks as I learned of new ways
			   to do things and thought of more elements that would look cool. I also sometimes use the site to host
			   pieces of projects for classes. To see the history of changes I've made to the site, check out my
			   <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/jojonium.github.io">GitHub</a> page.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, one of the issues I've run into is that I don't know what to actually write!
			   It turns out that creating good-looking pages is a lot easier than coming up with interesting
			   content to put on them.</p>
			
			<p>Also, I have discovered that CSS is annoying. Now I'm pretty competent with it, but it took
			   many frustrating hours to learn everything. For example, these parallax headers look really
			   cool, but it took a <i>very</i> long time to figure out how to position everything properly.</p>
			
			<div class="parallax p3">
				<div class="parallax-header" style="background-color: #e37682;">PARALLAX IS COOL</div>
			</div>
			
			<hr>
			
			<div id="vis" style="padding: 4em 3em .5em 0; float: left;"></div>
			
			<h2>Vega-Lite</h2>
			
			<p>However, it's not all HTML and CSS. I used some JavaScript to make the cool visualizations
			   across the site. The graphs on the <a href="film-stats.html">Film Stats</a> page were made using
			   <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>, a JSON schema for creating beautiful
			   graphs quickly and easily.</p>
			
			<p>I learned Vega-Lite for a class (CS 3041, Human Computer Interactions), and thought it would be 
               cool to apply what I learned to my own film data and see what I could make.</p>
			   
			<p>To the left is another Vega-Lite graph, this one showing the films I've watched each month by 
               release date. I'm not sure why there are two different categories for "null" and "undefined,"
               but I blame <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">TMDb</a>.</p>

            <canvas width="500" height="500" id="seen-canvas" style="float: right;"></canvas>

			<h2>seen.js</h2>
			 
			<p>The visualization on the <a href="index.html">front page</a> was created using <a href=
			   "http://seenjs.io">seen.js</a>, a JavaScript framework for rendering 3D scenes into an SVG or HTML5 canvas. The scenes are written in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, a cleaner and simpler language that compiles into JavaScript.</p>
			   
            <p>It was quite simple to just link the minified CoffeeScript and seen.js scripts and copy the 
               examples from the seen.js website. However, almost all of their examples (like the sphere to the
               right), were set to generate random colors for each surface. I wanted the colors of the main page visualization to match the color scheme of the site.</p>
               
            <p>I wanted the color of the surfaces to range smoothly between the two colors of the background,
               #e37682 and #5f4d93. I couldn't find a built-in function to do this, so I wrote one myself.
               First, seen.js applies colors to surfaces not with hex values, and not even with RGB, but with
               HSL values. It uses three numbers between 0 and 1, representing the hue, saturation, and 
               lightness of the color. Converted into hues, the two theme colors are 0.70833 and 0.980555. I
               wrote this snippet of CoffeeScript code to loop over each surface in the shape and apply a
               color:</p>
            
            <div class="code">
    hue = 0.70833
    for surface in shape.surfaces
        hue += (.272225) * (1 / shape.surfaces.length)
        surface.fill seen.Colors.hsl(hue, 0.5, 0.4)
            </div>
            
            
            <p>It applies the 0.70833 color to the
               first surface, then increments the hue by the difference between the two colors (.272225)
               multiplied by the inverse of the number of surfaces. This makes a smooth transition over the
               surface of the entire shape.</p>
