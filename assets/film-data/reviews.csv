2017-04-22,Eraserhead,1977,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/eraserhead/,4.5,"This film is definitely very strange, and honestly I don't know what to think of it. The lighting and sound design (and the sets) do a great job of conveying that surreal feeling. The practical effects are really great, and left me feeling genuinely unsettled. This might be the closest thing I've seen to a nightmare in film form.
I didn't really enjoy watching it, but it accomplished what it set out to do very well.",,2017-04-21
2017-04-23,The Big Lebowski,1998,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/the-big-lebowski/,5,"The dialogue and characters are really fantastic, acting is top tier, decent visuals. Overall it was very fun to watch. Almost every scene is quotable. Plays with a lot of interesting character archetypes. 10/10 music.",,2017-04-22
2017-04-23,Solaris,2002,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/solaris-2002/,3.5,Nice visuals and use of color. It feels kind of slow because of the lack of dialogue. It's interesting how the sci-fi plot is really just a pretense for a relationship drama. The psychological and dysfunctional relationship themes are explored in a good way.,,2017-04-22
2017-04-24,The Thing,1982,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/the-thing/,5,The practical effects in this movie are absolutely amazing. The lighting is used to great effect to heighten the sense of paranoia and fear. A great premise and realistic decisions and consequences. Spooky/10,,2017-04-23
2017-04-24,Powers of Ten,1977,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/powers-of-ten/,3,"This was pretty neat, for a 9 minute short. It's pretty cool that they were able to do the effects so smoothly, considering it was the 70s. I even learned a thing or two",Youtube,2017-04-24
2017-04-25,The Holy Mountain,1973,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/the-holy-mountain/,5,"Utterly indescribable and absolutely beautiful. Every single shot is a work of art. The attention to detail is amazing, and the imagery is like nothing I've ever seen before.",,2017-04-24
2017-04-26,Man of Steel,2013,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/man-of-steel/,3.5,"Someone should really tell modern movie studios that you can have action scenes without a cut every half a second. And that excessive bloom, lens flair, and half-assed CGI makes everything look shitty. Zack Snyder has a good eye for visuals, but isn't very good at camerawork. The camera is jumpy and moves way too much in scenes where it really shouldn't. This movie would be so much better if they just used a steadicam. The writing and thematic elements are nothing special, but they're certainly much better than your average modern blockbuster. The choreography is decent, but it's hard to see what's going on because of the rapid cuts and shaky cam.
Despite all that, the themes, symbolism, and characters make the movie still enjoyable.",,2017-04-25
2017-04-26,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice/,4,"""Yeah bro, just add a ton of artificial film grain, it'll make it look like they're really in a desert!""
At least Zack Snyder has invested in a couple of tripods and steadicams. The weird shaky camerawork is still present, but greatly reduced from Man of Steel. They've certainly taken this series in a very different direction than most of the source material. The writing and imagery are nothing special, but pretty good for a superhero film. The plot is pretty contrived, and too much of it was left unresolved to hype up the Justice League movie. The choreography is alright, and you can actually see it now that Snyder has his camerawork problems fixed. It still has the problem of cutting every half a second though. The music is pretty good, but the other sound design is nothing memorable. Overall the CGI was decent, but Doomsday was pretty bad.",,2017-04-25
2017-04-26,Suicide Squad,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/suicide-squad-2016/,1.5,"This movie thinks it will make me like it by having a great soundtrack of famous songs. It's wrong.
I thought the DCEU was supposed to be about making superheroes believable with real stakes. With all the cool and colorful villains in the DC universe that they could have used, the antagonist is instead Gerry Generic, the ancient evil type who wants to end the world just because he's evil. None of the leads are relatable or likeable, even though Deadshot and Captain Boomerang have every right to be. The dialogue is full-on Marvel quip mode, like it was written by 12 year olds. The Mexican fire guy was the only one with actual depth, and even that was the cheesy default kind, plus his arc was resolved way too fast. There were even some good ideas for interesting imagery and shots, but they were all executed so poorly.

+10 points for including Captain Boomerang
-100 points for managing to make Captain fucking Boomerang boring.

2017-04-27,Oldboy,2003,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/oldboy/,5,"Good camerawork and nice music. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but character actions and motivations don't always make a ton of sense. The action scenes are very well shot and well choreographed. The multiple-minute hallway fight scene with a lateral tracking shot without any cuts was honestly pretty impressive. The plot is very intriguing, and the writing is pretty good. There's some nice imagery too, especially near the end. 10/10 ending.",netflix,2017-04-26
2017-04-27,"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!",1956,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters/,4,"The shot direction and practical effects are actually pretty good, all things considered. Godzilla is pretty terrifying. The American editors cleverly spliced new scenes into the original film, and deleted some of the old ones, to basically make an totally new story. Godzilla suffers without some of the political statements of the original, but most of the message is basically intact.",,2017-04-26

2017-04-27,Bottle Rocket,1994,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/bottle-rocket/,3,"It's interesting to see how Wes Anderson's style evolved, but honestly this short film just wasn't very good. It feels like something a talented, but inexperienced film student made. The writing is alright, but the acting is mediocre. Some shots are good, but overall the shot composition is lacking.",Youtube,2017-04-26
2017-04-27,Moonrise Kingdom,2012,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/moonrise-kingdom/,4,"Wes Anderson is a truly talented director. He really knows how to capture that magical feeling of childhood. His sets feel like dollhouses and miniatures because of his unique camerawork. The 10/10 music also complements this feeling. The child actor's aren't very good, but most of the adults are great.",netflix,2017-04-26

2017-04-28,Naked Lunch,1991,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/naked-lunch/,3.5,"This movie is a literary high.
Music, set design, and costumes are all quite nice. The practical effects are also pretty good. The lighting and shot direction are good. I feel like I'm missing the main part of this movie. I understand the surface level, but I'm barely grasping at hints of the deeper layer. Maybe if I rewatch it a few times I'll start to get it more.",,2017-04-27
2017-04-28,Oklahoma City,2017,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/oklahoma-city/,1.5,"It's pretty informative about the events at Ruby Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City, but it puts a very obvious spin on it. Some of the information about The Turner Diaries is outright false, and they try to spin the feds as the ""good guys."" They totally gloss over the death of Sam Weaver, then spend a quarter of the film talking about the kids that died in Oklahoma City. The cinematography is nothing special, pretty standard interviews, stock footage, and news broadcasts. The music is bland and uninspired.",netflix,2017-04-27
2017-04-29,A Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995,2011,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/a-noble-lie-oklahoma-city-1995/,3,"There are clips from Info Wars in this documentary, so you kind of already know what direction it's going to go in. It takes a very different stance than the PBS documentary (not surprisingly). While <i>Oklahoma City</i> (2017) goes full on fed-fellating, <i>A Noble Lie</i> instead quickly recounts the official story, then goes into great detail into all the ways the Federal Government and the media have lied about the events.
Unfortunately, the cinematography and sound design is just mediocre.",youtube,2017-04-28
2017-04-30,Inception,2010,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/inception/,4.5,"Modern filmmakers seem to have some disease where it's physically impossible for them to make an action scene without using more cuts than an edgy teenager.
This is honestly a good movie, but it would be a great movie if it weren't for the uninspired action scenes, filled with shaky cam and stupid quips. Aside of the action sequences, there are some very clever connections between different parts of the film that make it very enjoyable to rewatch. The imagery is very creative, and most of the visuals are pretty amazing. The concept is cool, and executed well. The plot can be a little confusing at times, but it all ends up tying together nicely to make sense. Some of the rules of the dream world were kind of inconsistent (when do drops work?) The music is great, and and the ending is 10/10.",,2017-04-29

2017-05-03,Hot Fuzz,2007,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/hot-fuzz/,4.5,"Very creative use of clever match cuts for comedic purposes. The rapid cuts and great sound design lead to some creative gags. However, the fast camera movement makes some action scenes hard to follow.

The writing is pretty good, and the acting is above average. The tone is inconsistent, and swings wildly from tragedy to comedy, which can be kind of jarring.",,2017-05-03
2017-05-05,Train to Busan,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/train-to-busan/,4,"The plot is nothing special, standard zombie affair. Characters are pretty generic archetypes, but they interact well together. Even though they were generic, the characters are written and acted so well that they made me really like some of them. It manages to create some very intense and emotional moments. Visual style and shot direction are nice. Bonus points for always being bright and colorful too. The brief CGI sequences are pretty bad. I like that they kept in the tight, cramped urban environment. It was different from most zombie movies, and contributed to the tension.",netflix,2017-05-04
2017-05-06,Primer,2004,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/primer/,4.5,"Interesting concept, reminds me a lot of Steins;Gate. The acting is alright from the main leads, but side characters are pretty mediocre. The excessive film grain can be annoying, but the shot composition is generally good. It's pretty hard to follow the plot, but I think I understood it.  The writing is good, and the dialogue usually feels natural. It's hard to hear sometimes though.",,2017-05-05
2017-05-06,Watchmen,2009,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/watchmen/,4,"Zack Snyder sure likes his slow-mo. This is what superhero movies truly can be. The plot is great and well written, most of the characters are interesting and have realistic motivations, and the dialogue is actually decent. The fight scenes are well directed and aren't plagued by quick-cuts. The soundtrack is nice, but all the original songs are forgettable. The ending is god-tier. Even the shot direction and imagery are pretty good. However, the special effects and CGI have not aged well. Likewise, the animation in the Black Sails segments is mediocre. Overall, this sets a high standard for superhero movies that is rarely matched.",,2017-05-05
2017-05-07,Zootopia,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/zootopia/,3,"The animation and lighting are pretty nice, as expected of Disney. The characters are pretty generic archetypes, but the voice actors do a good job of fleshing out their personality. It falls into a lot of children's movie cliches, and the plot is very predictable.

Animation is decent, although the backgrounds are lackluster and the CGI has not aged well. The voice acting is average, and character designs are nothing new. The plot is safe and predictable, and the writing is uninspired. Some moments are legitimately funny, and I think it still holds up as a decent children's movie.",netflix,2017-05-06

The cinematography was good throughout as well, with well-composed shots and good use of lighting (except for the strobe effects, which were awful). The plot isn't very original, but it manages to pull it off well. For a horror movie, it wasn't particularly scary, but the creature designs and effects were good. The visuals are really what make this movie. That ending triggered me.",,2017-05-22
2017-05-23,Sound of My Voice,2011,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/sound-of-my-voice/,4,"Good acting and nice use of music, for an indie film. The lighting and cinematography felt very much like an indie film though. Plays with some interesting themes and ideas about faith and control. At first I didn't like the ending, but the more I think about it the more perfect it seems. There's a lot of good suspense throughout, but it doesn't really build  up to any answers. It toes the line between intelligent and pretentious.",,2017-05-22

Pretty much everything is absolutely on point and working together for this film's message, from the camera work, to the acting (which I hated at first, but eventually I got it), to the set/costume design, to the music.

2017-05-25,[REC],2007,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/rec/,4,"One of the better found footage films I've seen, it effectively uses the in-universe camera to create tension. Despite rarely speaking, the protagonist and camera-operator is quite likable, unlike every other character. The beginning and buildup to zombie horror is slow and adds a lot of atmosphere. The acting is pretty good, and the long times between cuts make it more impressive. There are a few cheap jump scares, but the film overall did rattle me.",,2017-05-24

It's 50% stupid quips and 50% frogpost-worthy clichés. The whole plot was set up just to wallow in fans' nostalgia for the original Star Wars. The cinematography is boring and generic, there's loads of unnecessary CGI, and the set/character design is either ugly or copied directly from the original. The protagonists are a unlikable Mary Sue and an annoying idiot, and neither of them can act. Actually, none of the acting is very good. Everything in the plot seems to happen just by sheer coincidence, in order to keep the plot moving forward to make sure little Timmy doesn't lose interest if there's ever five nanoseconds without any action. The plot and characters and just a rehash of the original Star Wars. How do we raise the stakes after the Death Star? Oh I know, just make a bigger Death Star!
Why are the rebels still fighting the new Empire despite everything that happened in the original trilogy? Why does Finn have a change of heart after seeing a single stormtrooper die, then seconds later gun down dozens of them?

No cuts means the camera has to be constantly orbiting around people. The cuts are always disguised really badly too, usually with shitty CGI.
Movies about actors always seem pretentious and self-fellating to me, and this is no exception. A lot of the writing isn't very good either.

2017-05-31,Guardians of the Galaxy,2014,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy/,1,"This has the same problems as almost every other Marvel movie: a bland and generic score, washed out visuals, annoying quip-filled dialogue, overuse of CGI, and as many clichés as they could fit. It's just another dumbed-down Disney blockbuster trash, aimed at the lowest common denominator. Every action scene is either fully CGI, or contains two cuts every second, or both. As if that wasn't bad enough, all the violence is utterly toothless. No main characters ever get injured, and the villains either die in a cartoonish way or offscreen. The most you'll get is a ""crunch"" sound effect and the implication of a broken bone off screen. As a result, nothing ever feels threatening or tense. There are no consequences in this universe. It seems like they were trying to not make this a kid's movie, with all the lame forced sexual references, but the action and plot still feels like it was written for (and by) 12 year olds. The pacing is faster and more frenetic than a squirrel with ADHD. They're constantly moving to a new location and set piece to keep the target audience of middle schoolers entertained. None of the main characters were likeable, most of them came off as dicks. The villain is a mustache-twirlingly evil just because the plot demands it.",,2017-05-30

It's nice to see Ripley's character fleshed out a little more, and the setting is better than Aliens. The set design is kind of bland though. The way the alien moves is amazing, but the way it's superimposed on the other images is awful, which is a shame. The special effects being so bad really detracts from what could have been great.

The Alien movies have this problem of not being scary because none of the characters are scared. They're always angry instead of terrified. There were a few moments in Alien where Ripley was alone and scared, and those were the most tense and exciting parts.

""Oh jeez, late 90s CGI... It might still have a good plot at least--""
>Written by Joss Whedon
DROPPED

It's the late 90s, you know what that means? Terrible CGI! Aliens was an unnecessary sequel that had to be pulled out of the ass of a satisfying ending. Alien 3 was an unnecessary sequel to that. Nobody asked for this and we didn't need it. The story had a conclusive end, and Ripley's ending was important. The writing is really bad. Genetic memories, cloned Ripley, Walmart references, really weird dirty talk, stupid names, it's got everything. Sigourney Weaver is getting old. Where did the shady military guys get a sample of Ripley's blood? If the clone has memories because xenomorphs have genetic memory (which itself is ridiculous), how does she have Ripley's old memories? Ripley's brain was destroyed and all they had to work with was blood samples. Why do the xenomorphs now scream like dinosaurs and attack people who are in groups? ""Who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?"" The main character faces no danger, she has super powers, acid blood, and the xenomorphs don't attack her. Even if Call is supposed to be the protagonist, she can't get injured either. How is this supposed to be tense and scary when there is no threat? They didn't even make a physical full xenomorphs model, only the head. Have I mentioned that the writing is really bad? Because it is legitimately horrible. Why did the doctor want to bring the ship back to Earth? How did glasses-kun go berserk and become immune to bullets? Was the chestburster controlling him?

The characters are all very one dimensional and I didn't end up caring about any of them. The CGI ranges from passable at best to SFM porn quality at worst. I was only in this for the cool naval combat action, but it's a full 45 minutes in before the first shot is even fired.

Man, those dastardly Germans sure are evil. Killing their own officers for no reason, killing unarmed women and children, throwing prisoners into gas chambers... Wait, wasn't this supposed to be World War I? And it turns out the Germans weren't being manipulated by Ares at all, they're just evil people. Our heroine, Jew, Israeli citizen,and former IDF member Gal Gadot has to use the power of love (and plot armor) to stop those villainous Germans from gassing six million innocent civilians. Can you tell this film was written by Jews yet?
Chosen people aside, there is the expected gender politics, although fortunately it isn't <i>too</i> in your face.
Ignoring the politics, <i>Wonder Woman</i> is a decent superhero origin story. Some of the exposition is hamfisted, and the writing is pretty mediocre, but it's still an entertaining watch. Gal Gadot isn't a great actor, but Chris Pines makes up for her. The action scenes are filled with CGI, and the camera if often so close you can't tell what's going on.

It's certainly less straightforward than <i>Drive</i> or <i>Only God Forgives</i>, using a lot more symbolic rather than literal imagery. It wants to explore themes and make a statement more than it wants to tell a literal story. The commentary on beauty, fashion, entertainment, and society is told well with the fantastic visuals.

The plot of this first OVA was pretty slow, with a lot of time spent introducing things and providing exposition. This is okay since it's the first part of a series, but as a standalone it's kind of slow. Lelouch was a great character because he was flawed: he couldn't fight, he was physically the weakest guy around, and he got outsmarted by clever opponents all the time.

The story is a classic midlife crisis tale, and Lester Burnham is a great character, a sum of great writing and acting. The cinematography and lighting are nice, I especially liked how the visual motif of roses (and the color red) kept showing up just when you had almost forgotten about it.

It kind of reminds me of <i>Primer</i> if it actually had a budget. The writing is pretty hit or miss. Sometimes it's intelligent and clever (a lot of the technobabble actually kind of makes sense), and sometimes it's just cringey and awkward. It triggers me that the machine designs look cool and almost realistic, and yet the computer screens are the most generic and least creative computer screens ever. ""How do we show a high tech program?"" ""Just put a bunch of random monitors everywhere with lines of scrolling numbers that change randomly."" The narrative structure was disorienting and confusing at first, until I realized it was being disorienting and confusing on purpose. It does instill that feeling of paranoia and amnesia.

Similarly, there a few times when some subtle spooky music is played that cannot possibly come from within the diegesis. That said, I especially like the use of video glitches, plus I'll give bonus points because they actually look like real video glitches. Lots of good suspense, but overly reliant on jump scares.

Why would they use CGI for the Thing? The practical effects of the original was one of the best parts of it. And the CGI is phenomenally bad, especially the shots in bright lighting. The beginning is at least competently made, and actually adds some interesting background to the original, but it quickly goes downhill from there.
In Carpenter's <i>The Thing</i>, all the characters were all rational, logical people, the human conflicts came from them being scared and paranoid. In this remake/prequel, most of the human conflict comes from Edvard being a dick for no reason and other characters just being dumb.
One thing I liked from <i>The Thing</i> (1982) was that the characters all figured out how the Thing worked right away, and the real struggle was figuring out how to fight it. It takes 45 minutes before Kate figures out how the Thing works in this one, and even then everyone else refuses to believe her. Why don't they believe her? I don't know, because the writer wanted more human drama to stretch out the runtime. 
In the original, the Thing was terrifying because it only struck when no one was looking (or at least it tried to). It only showed itself when forced to. This Thing is more than willing to jump out at Kate when there are tons of people around and run down the hall screaming.
At 1:12:30, Kate just stands there like an idiot while holding a working flamethrower, letting the Thing escape. Kurt Russell would never have let that happen.
The ending is also pretty dumb, especially compared to the original. I do like that the end credits set up the beginning of <i>The Thing</i> (1982), although it did make it obvious through the film that the only non-English speaker would survive.",hooptober4.0,2017-10-11

This has aged surprisingly well. It's interesting seeing a zombie movie from a time before zombies had absolutely saturated all entertainment to the point that there is no way to make them interesting any more. It still holds up as a great atmospheric horror, about being trapped, alone, not knowing who to trust or what to do.
The first few minutes are a great example of exposition done right. We immediately understand who the two characters are, what they're like, how they're related, and what they're here to do, and yet the dialogue still feels very natural. The writing stays consistently great throughout the whole film.

Of the three films in the ""Dead Trilogy,"" <i>Day of the Dead</i> has the best gore and makeup, but the worst characters. The titular Dead have gone from being the primary antagonist in <i>Night</i>, to a lesser foe in <i>Dawn</i>, to nothing more than a plot device in <i>Day</i>. Continuing the trend from the second half of <i>Dawn</i>, the humans are the real antagonists here. Specifically the military jarheads, who are guaranteed to act stupid and unreasonable in every scene they're in. All of the army characters are completely two-dimensional, existing only to provide a source of conflict. The protagonist, Sarah, is a little more fleshed out, but still pretty flat compared to some previous characters from the trilogy.

You know, between this, <i>Lost in Translation</i>, <i>Enter the Void</i>, <i>House</i>, and every Godzilla movie ever, Japan doesn't seem like a very nice place to live. Anyway, <i>Noroi</i> is a good example of how to do found footage horror right. The protagonist, Kobayashi, is great. He's relatable, likable, and most importantly smart. Since found footage is basically from the perspective of the protagonist all the time, it's very important for them to be someone you can like and relate to (i.e.
 not the guy from <i>Cloverfield</i>). It's mystery as much as horror, and we the audience piece together the information as Kobayashi does. Things are connected in ways that are logical and make sense. <i>Noroi</i> is also good at following the rules of found footage: there's always a valid reason for someone to be filming, people put the camera down when they have to (except in the very last scene, which was quite infuriating), and there are no shots that don't make sense in the diegesis of the film. There aren't even any credits, except for the characters in the film.

The Steadicam tracking shots are great, especially the ones following Danny on his bike (Kubrick actually worked with the inventor of the Steadicam to invent a new version of it for these shots).
The set designs are perfect: memorable, unique, and incredibly unnerving.
Jack Nicholson's acting is great.

All these close-ups are giving me claustrophobia. Also, there is a page from Matt Furie's ""Boy's Club"" shown in this movie. That's all you need to know.

The music is god-tier, and works really well with the close-up heavy visual style to create this extremely intense, nerve wracking atmosphere. Unlike <i>Baby Driver</i>, when things go wrong in this heist movie it's for a logical reason: Connie underestimates the cops, or makes a realistic mistake, or people don't react the way he expects them to. It makes the flow of the plot feel much more organic and plausible. It also builds genuine tension.

A mixture of awful writing, baffling casting, and terrible acting make Valerian and Laureline some of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen. They have absolutely no chemistry with each other, a problem which is only worsened by the clichéd script and their uninterested, monotonic delivery. Valerian and Laureline are also just jerks. They act like pompous ""too cool for school"" braggarts even to their direct superiors (and somehow get away with it). People want to root for honest underdogs, not arrogant dicks. They continue quipping and joking around seconds after several of their teammates are viciously torn apart by an alien monster.
The French's love of big government is very clear, as is their fear of guns. The nations of the world have all peacefully come together into the ""United Human Federation,"" ruled by some kind of oligarchical council. The first few minutes of the film are spent showing the progress of the International Space Station as it grows along with a multicultural crew of every race and origin, especially the Chinese (wouldn't want to miss out on access to the Chinese market). All the guns in <i>Valerian and the Script of a Thousand Clichés</i> are either some special nonlethal variety (like the slightly disturbing mind control gun), hilariously ineffective, or instant kill death rays, varying randomly depending on what the plot depends.
Speaking of plot, remember <i>Pocahontas</i> and <i>Avatar</i>? Now you also know the plot of <i>Valerian and the Native American Allegory</i>. A magical and peaceful native race lives peacefully and harmoniously for hundreds of years until the evil white man destroys their culture. A soldier from the aggressive side must fight own people to save the poor oppressed natives, etc. etc. 
Though it may not sound like it, I did actually like <i>Valerian and the Movie of a Thousand VFX Artists</i>. All the negative things I've said are really a shame, because there is some genuine creativity and talent on display here. The alien designs (though all basically humanoid) are pretty cool, and the environment and costume designs are colorful and unique. The military robots especially stood out to me. It's impressive that despite the extensive use of CGI, most of the time it didn't look too bad. If you like sci-fi spectacle, <i>Valerian and the Extremely Long Title</i> may be worth watching for that alone. I actually like that the plot gets constantly sidetracked, because the sidetracks are excuses to show off new and amazing things about the world, and are usually more interesting than than the plot they're distracting from.

Also why have a hearing at all if you only needed to tell one guy one thing? The reason they call witnesses is to ask them questions. The weather-controlling satellites idea is cool, but the satellite designs are really dumb. What's the point of having the big net instead of having them all be independent? And why would a fucking satellite have a standard computer cooling fan in it? Anyway, so one of the satellites malfunctions and freezes a town in the desert (which is pretty cool actually, if you don't think about how that's possible). So instead of letting the international team members who are already on the space station fix it (which is, you know, their job), they need Gerard Butler to go fix it because he's the protagonist. Then we get this really weird action scene where there's another malfunction causing extreme heat in Hong Kong, which somehow causes underground oil pipes to explode and buildings to collapse, but doesn't kill anyone just from the heat. Then there's a badly written ""emotional"" scene between the main character and his daughter where someone accidentally turned up the bloom way too high. I'm here to see cities get destroyed, not for this cliché forced emotional bullshit. Also I think someone told the set designer that ""spinning space station = artificial gravity,"" but then they never followed through with anything that would make it actually plausible. Then there are a bunch more cliché scenes and we find out what anyone with a brain had already guessed: the malfunctions were intentional. And Max thinks it was caused by the President so that the international team takes the blame, but wasn't he the one that insisted they send a single American instead of an international team in the first place? You'd think Max would realize this makes no sense, especially since he was there. It's played off like a big plot twist, for some reason.
Still, I don't really care about all the clichés, the bad writing, the ignorance of physics, the weak characterization, the obligatory disaster movie dog that doesn't die. I'm just here to watch cities get destroyed. But <i>Geostorm </i>can't even deliver on that. I swear, there were only like ten minutes of actual weather disasters in the film.

The weather scenes we did get were pretty cool, I liked the way the Chinese pandering character's windshield fogged up as soon as he got out of the heat zone. I just wish there had been more of them. It's the same problem <i>Godzilla </i>(2014) had: not enough of the destructive force the movie is named after.",,2017-11-22

2017-11-25,Justice League,2017,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/justice-league/,2.5,"Meh. Not as bad as <i>Suicide Squad</i> but nowhere near as good as <i>Man of Steel</i>.
For how much Warner Bros. is trying to copy Marvel's formula, they could have at least copied the one thing Disney did right: don't blow your load too early. We should have gotten an origin movie à la <i>Man of Steel</i> and <i>Wonder Woman</i> for all of the heroes. As it stands, <i>Justice League</i> just raised a bunch of questions about Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman. In one scene, Aquaman is talking to some Atlantean woman, and says ""I need something from you,"" then we cut to another scene and never find out what it was or who he was talking to. I assume he meant the trident he later shows up with, but now I'm just wondering why it's important (it seems like just an ordinary pointy stick in the film) and why he didn't already have it. Cyborg also raises a lot of questions. I thought his robot body was able to change and modify itself to frankly ridiculous levels because it was made out of a mother box (the magical Macguffins), but it turns out it's not. So what are the robotic parts of him made out of, and where did they come from?
Anyway, as for the movie itself, it could have been a lot better. I don't like the casting decisions for Cyborg and Barry, but Aquaman was decent I guess. A lot of the writing is really bad, and you can tell it was originally a much different (and longer) movie that was chopped up and rearranged by Joss Whedon. The reshoots are very obvious and jarring, as Ben Affleck looks very different between consecutive scenes and shots. The CGI is also inexcusably bad, especially for a movie with a $300 million budget. Superman's face and Steppenwolf's entire body are particularly bad.
And that brings us to Steppenwolf, possibly the worst thing about <i>Justice League</i>. The villains in superhero films are often the most interesting thing in them. Zod was a great villain, with realistic and logical motivations and a clear way of achieving them. Lex Luthor was a little over the top sometimes in <i>BvS</i>, but he was intelligent and had a clear plan and motivations. Steppenwolf, on the other hand, is the laziest kind of villain. He is evil simply for the sake of being evil. He wants to conquer the world and transform it into Apokolips... why, exactly? His motivations make no sense, his powers are boring (wow he's tall and strong and has an ax, what creative genius came up with that), and his minions are totally useless. He just comes out of nowhere, tries to take over the world, and gets beaten. Also, for someone who knows exactly where the mother boxes are (somehow), and can teleport directly to them, it sure takes him a long time for him to actually grab them all and get started.
While there were some cool moments (Flash being terrified upon realizing that Superman can keep up with his movements for the first time was pretty cool), <i>Justice League</i> failed to live up to its potential. The whole thing felt rushed (it's really short compared to, say, <i>BvS</i>), the effects were bad, the villain was boring, and the plot is full of holes. It was at least mildly entertaining, but if this is the way future Warner Bros./DC movies are going to be, I'm pretty disappointed. Maybe they'll release a longer Zack Snyder cut that will fix some of these issues.",theater,2017-11-24

</i>Why do zombie movies never have a consistent amount of time between being bitten and turning into a ghoul? It always varies depending on how dramatic it would be for the plot, and that always bugs me. That nitpick aside, I do like this colorful, urban, brightly lit style of Asian zombie movies shown by <i>Train to Busan</i> and this. It's actually a lot like <i>Train to Busan</i>, with a little <i>Day of the Dead</i> mixed in too. But honestly, it's more about the beta uprising than zombies. ""Everyone's a NEET now. We're equal.""
The action scenes and special effects in general are done very well. All the hits feel very impactful. Bonus points for actually depicting guns realistically. The zombies are slightly different from the standard affair, although it's basically the same gimmick from the Romero dead trilogy. The main character, Hideo, is a good zombie movie protagonist, because he's just an average guy trying his best to survive and be cool.
Unfortunately the middle part of the film dragged along, and was very predictable. Wow, they find a group of survivors holed up in a shopping center, and it turns out the other survivors are selfish assholes and ""dude humans are the real monsters lmao."" The uniqur setting and characters were what made <i>Train to Busan</i> so good. While <i>I Am a Hero</i> does the basic zombie plot well, it's not really anything new past the first act. And then it just ends when they ran out of ideas for action scenes, without any kind of meaningful conclusion.

2017-11-26,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story/,1.5,"This movie was shit. Not as bad as <i>The Force Awakens</i>, but it was still trash. In short, the characters were poorly fleshed out, the plot was a mess, the whole thing was a foregone conclusion if you’ve seen <i>Star Wars</i>, yet it also manages to directly contradict <i>Star Wars</i>, the music is generic, and the story is full of holes. The scenery is pretty good though. The full list of everything I found wrong with it (and the few things it did right) is below, in chronological order:

No introductory text crawl, no fanfare, just jumping right into the movie. I guess I respect that they’re trying to differentiate this from the mainline Star Wars movies. Then we have Krennic’s ship landing on some random planet which does admittedly look very nice. Actually, most of the scenery and even a lot of the CGI looks very good in this film. Anyway, I guess Krennic is a special snowflake and the standard Imperial transport ships weren’t good enough for him (or maybe Disney just wanted to design a cool new ship). They park really far away just so Jyn’s family has time to prepare and so we can get a cool shot of them walking. And we get this awkwardly long shot of blue milk in Jyn’s house and you can practically hear the creative committee going “hey, remember blue milk? Remember <i>Star Wars</i>™ from your childhood?” And so Jyn runs to hide and her mom sacrifices herself for no real reason except that Disney’s Big Book of Clichés™ said that protagonists aren’t allowed to have living parents. Seriously though, why didn’t they all just hide in that bunker? There was definitely enough room. When the Empire showed up and found the place deserted, they would have just given up and left, just like they did after spending five minutes searching for Jyn.
I really hate when films feel the need to tell us the name of every location in big white letters in the corner of the screen every time the location changes. I was just admiring a neat shot of a city built on two asteroids when “RING OF KAFRENE: TRADING OUTPOST” appears in ugly letters to ruin the moment. This is the laziest method of exposition. Anyway, then we see main character guy talking to some random person, who seems to be helping him and actually giving him information. And Mr. Main Character with Unspecific Accent just murders him in cold blood for no reason. Seriously, this scene was baffling to me. 
Then we cut to a completely different planet (actually a moon, as the annoying location titles helpfully told me), and completely different characters we’ve met before. Now we’ve had three scenes in a row in completely different locations with completely unrelated characters. This is not coherent storytelling, this is just a mess. Some guy needs to deliver a message to someone else, and that’s all we learn before cutting to yet another totally unrelated scene.
Someone who I assume is Jyn gets “rescued” from the Empire by people who I assume are the rebels. Then we jump again to <b>another</b> random planet. It’s 13 minutes into the movie and we’re already on the fifth planet. At least this scene is connected to the last one. It’s just a big confusing exposition dump, but at least we find out how cold-blooded murderer guy is relevant. But how did the rebels find Jyn in the first place? Why did they think Saw Gerrera knew where Galen was? Well at least we meet K-2SO, the first likable character in this movie.
A bunch more stuff happens, and I think I’m beginning to actually understand what the basic plot is, though the characters are still a total mystery with more being introduced every minute.
Remember how I said earlier that some of the CGI actually looks good? I was talking about the scenery only, because Tarkin’s CGI zombie face looks as jarring and unnatural as you could imagine.
Then we’re back on Jedha, where they park very far away again for no reason. And apparently star destroyers can enter planetary atmospheres. Was this ever established before? Because it might have helped the Empire a lot if this could happen at other points in the movies (I’m looking at you, battle of Hoth). As Jyn and Murderer-kun are walking through the streets of Jedha (is Jedha the name of the planet, or the city?), they happen to bump into the two guys from the Cantina scene in <i>Star Wars</i> (1977), by pure coincidence, because the fans love blatant nostalgia bait. Speaking of obvious pandering, we get a random out of place Chinese guy out of nowhere, because apparently we didn’t have enough poorly developed characters yet.
Then we get an incomprehensible fight scene, because we’re thirty minutes into the movie and don’t want the kiddies to fall asleep. I’m not really sure because fight scenes this awful are really hard to follow, but it seems like Murderer-kun (I found out his name is Cassian from the subtitles) shoots a rebel who was about to throw a bomb at some stormtroopers because... I don’t really know. They should be on the same team, both fighting against the stormtroopers. And it’s not to protect Jyn, because the bomb ends up exploding closer to her than where the guy was going to throw it. I really don’t know, I guess he’s just a serial killer who the rebels all put up with for some reason.
Then Jyn singlehandedly beats up four stormtroopers using only a baton, then shoots two more and a killer robot because “gurl power.” Keep in mind these are supposed to be heavily armored, professional Imperial soldiers and she’s a tiny girl with a stick. I guess every Star Wars movie has to have a pro-feminism agenda now, thanks Kathleen Kennedy. Well, at least we get more of K-2SO being the only good character.
The protagonists are almost captured by the Empire until Chinese Pandering Guy saves the day, defeating dozens of stormtroopers using only a stick, because Disney needs money from the Chinese market.
Then Saw Gerrera’s men capture the protagonists, rightfully since Cassian McMurder randomly killed one of them. There’s some more talking, and the Death Star is tested by blowing up the city of Jedha. While the destruction looks very pretty, it doesn’t really make any sense. I thought Jedha was an “Imperial Occupied Moon.” Why would they test the weapon by blowing up one of their own cities? Maybe the rebel presence on Jedha was stronger than I thought, but then why does the establishing shot subtitle identify it as “Imperial Occupied?” And Saw stays behind to die for no reason, he just says “I won’t run anymore.” That doesn’t really explain anything, but the writers needed him out of the plot so I guess he’s dead now.
Then there’s a scene where Krennic acts like a spoiled kid (and Ben Mendelsohn’s acting here is especially bad), and Tarkin is still living in the uncanny valley.
Then the rebellion finds out that the weapon is real and online, and they know where Galen Erso is, and the rebel leader guy says “my orders still stand, keep to the plan.” How does this make any sense at all? The original plan was to kill Galen so that he couldn’t finish the Death Star for the Empire, but now that they know the Death Star is already operational they still need to kill Galen... why exactly?
Didn’t Saw tell the pilot guy that when he got tentacle raped by the mind reading monster that he would probably go insane? Because the pilot seems perfectly fine now that we see him again. Oh well, who needs continuity. Also Cassian says they can’t send a message to the rebels because they’re in the middle of Imperial territory, but the rebels have no trouble sending orders to their ship. At least until it crashes, but nobody got hurt. I guess they just needed to steal a different ship to keep the plot moving.
Then they find Galen, and Cassian still wanted to kill him for some reason. Even if he doesn’t believe Jyn about the Death Star weakness, if the Death Star is already complete (as he saw with his own eyes) why would killing Galen matter? Then there’s a brief battle caused solely by a miscommunication between the rebel commanders and the Cassian. Also, if the rebel fleet could get to Eadu so fast (they were only dispatched after Cassian’s ship crashed), why didn’t they just send the rebel fleet in the first place instead of having Jyn and Cassian do it?
Then Jyn confronts Cassian for trying to kill Galen. Now, Cassian is a cold-blooded murderer, but how did Jyn know that he wanted to kill Galen? Just because K-2SO said his weapon was in “sniper setting?” He could have been using the scope just to scout. 
Apparently Darth Vader has an evil doom castle literally on a river of lava. Because we wouldn’t want the kiddies to be confused about whether or not he’s evil. The actor in the suit for Vader is completely wrong, and doesn’t feel like Vader from the original trilogy. He doesn’t move like Vader at all. The voice is only slightly off, so I guess it’s alright. Krennic is being a whiny bitch again, and Vader force chokes him just so he can deliver a lame quip.
Then we get an “inspiring” scene where Jyn fails to convince the rebels to steal the death star plans. And at this time I’d like to point out how disappointing the music in this movie is. It’s really generic and uninspired, with only very brief references to John Williams’ fantastic score from the original trilogy. It’s really disappointing, since the original trilogy had one of the best musical scores ever.
Then the main characters go to Scarif to steal the Death Star plans. The scenery actually looks very nice, and the set design is good too. At one point we see the rebels planting explosives, and for some of them they need to turn the dial on the explosive for it to start ticking, and other times it starts ticking as soon as they stick it to something. I know it’s a small nit to pick, but a lot of little annoying details add up to one big annoying movie.
Director Krennic is also on Scarif, supposedly because he wants every transmission Galen ever sent to be analyzed. This doesn’t really make sense though, he knows that Galen conspired with a pilot, so it’s probably safe to assume he sent the message in some kind of physical medium. And they know that the pilot’s ship went to Jedha, so maybe if they just searched Jedha they could find out who the message was delivered to—oh wait, they blew Jedha up for no reason. So I guess Krennic is really just here because they need a villain for the final battle.
The battle commences, and I guess it’s at least done competently. Although aimbot guy makes me wonder why everyone doesn’t get one of those guns. Then AT-ATs show up, because nostalgia. Why do they even have AT-ATs on a base that’s built on a series of tropical islands? I don’t think they’d be very good at walking through water. The original trilogy was constantly introducing new ships and vehicles designed for different situations, but Disney would rather rely on nostalgia than spend the effort to be creative.
I’ll admit, most of the final battle is visually interesting and downright cool. Why did it have to be attached to the preceding hour and a half of shit?
Then K-2SO, the only interesting character in this movie, dies. So there’s this whole subplot going on in the background where the pilot guy has to tell the rebels to open the shield gate, and it takes him a really long time to do this for various contrived reasons. But why didn’t the rebels already know that? The rebels that were stuck outside the shield gate had been trying to destroy it since it closed. Why did they need to be specifically told to do it? Well, it gives the Chinese guy a chance to save the day, so it makes perfect sense from Disney’s perspective.
Then there’s a ridiculous scene in which a star destroyer lightly bumps into another star destroyer, and somehow cuts through it like butter.
Krennic confronts Jyn on top of a tower because Disney’s Big Book of Clichés™ says that’s how you should end a battle, and he’s killed in an incredibly anticlimactic way. Then everyone dies, which should surprise no one since the whole thing was a foregone conclusion if you’ve seen <i>Star Wars</i>. And there’s a fanfiction-tier scene with Vader killing a bunch of rebel soldiers, because Disney knows that fans will cream themselves over it. Leia’s CGI zombie face also looks creepy and fake.
Now, probably the worst and most incomprehensible thing about this movie is that it directly contradicts what is said in <i>Star Wars</i>. Disney had the entire plot laid out for them and they still screwed it up. In the beginning of <i>Star Wars</i>, Vader says “where are those transmissions you intercepted?” It also makes the claim that the ship is on a diplomatic mission laughable, since it just escaped from an active battle in <i>Rogue One</i>. Vader also says “Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies,” which is also contradicted by <i>Rogue One</i>. The main characters of <i>Rogue One</i> are definitely not spies (the movie probably would have been more interesting if they had been), and the transmission was beamed to a different ship and carried onto this one on a disk. I’m sure Disney will release a “special edition” of <i>Disney’s® Star Wars™: Episode IV: A New Hope™</i> with those scenes “digitally enhanced” to fit with <i>Rogue One</i>.",netflix,2017-11-25

Although Clint Eastwood vastly overestimates his own acting ability, it is interesting to see a Hollywood movie with a right wing director. A positive portrayal of religion, a female character who isn't there to push a feminist agenda, the message that hard work = success, and a negative portrayal of welfare fraud are all very rare for Hollywood.

My favorite Wes Anderson film without a doubt. It takes a while to get going, but the story and characters are so personal and well written. The soundtrack is fantastic, both the David Bowie and the original tracks. Wes Anderson's visuals are amazing, as always. Lots of blues and yellows this time, and I love the stop motion creatures. They lend this fantastical element to the story that I think really benefits it. It works on so many levels, as Steve Zissou's complicated journey to being a good father, as Ned's quest to find himself, as Jane's voyage to reconcile her disappointment with herself. It has moments of great humor and heartfelt intimacy. Like almost everything by Wes Anderson, it's colorful depression with just enough hope to make you smile through the sadness.",,2017-11-29

It basically is the same as the previous two films (<i>Songs from the Second Floor</i>, and <i>You, the Living</i>), but better.

I guess they add a layer of realism, even if I know they're staged. <i>The Taking of Deborah Logan</i> does a decent job of setting up a realistic excuse for the characters to have cameras on them all the time, and it generally plays by its own rules. It seems like a lot of scenes are cut short the keep the pace moving, and there are times when I wish they would let the action play out instead of using these quick cuts. Also, the only time fake static and video degradation has been spooky was in <i>The Poughkeepsie Tapes</i>, and that's because the video was supposed to be on VHS tapes that had been rotting in a closet for years. In this, which I assume is supposed to be filmed on modern digital cameras, the static and visual artifacts look incredibly fake. They also only show up at the spookiest moments, purely by coincidence I'm sure. There's also generic horror movie music and ambient spooky sounds thrown in randomly, completely ignoring the found footage context.
The horror elements are a mix of interesting, actually unnerving things (like teleporting onto a counter while sleepwalking), and generic, unoriginal shit (like the ""spooky"" deserted hospital wing where the lights don't work.

The story is unique, and the dream sequences and animation (and music) are absolutely amazing, but it just doesn't have the same emotional resonance as <i>Perfect Blue</i> or even <i>Tokyo Godfathers</i>. There's never really any sense of danger or suspense, because the rules of the dream world are so ill-defined that pretty much anything could happen to get the protagonists into, or out of, danger. The climax is solved by a solution that seemed to come out of nowhere (yes, I get the symbolism, but it doesn't work from a plot perspective). With that said, <i>Paprika</i> is still a good film, maybe even a great one. Much of the imagery and music is truly creative, and the main characters are likable and interesting.

Barry Keoghan gives a fantastic performance, and Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman are great too. Their Lanthimos-esque line delivery, along with the music, creates a disturbing atmosphere. Even when the characters are talking about something perfectly normal and positive, it just feels scary and wrong.

Some of the cinematography looks nice, even though it doesn't do anything new. Anyway, the way she actually gets out is really dumb. And I get that they were trying to do a sort of ""rhyming"" thing between Jessie's repressed memories and her current situation, it just comes off as really shallow and forced. And the subplot with the creepy murderer guy was completely unnecessary. I don't think I could have thought of a more cringe-worthy ending if I tried.

Man, it was really a simpler time, nowadays that joke would be attacked for being insensitive and offensive.
Anyway, I feel like <i>Ocean's Twelve</i> kind of missed the point of the original. I would have been happy if this was just another high-profile heist with a twist, maybe with higher stakes and a more creative twist. Instead, the heist itself isn't really the focus of this film, and the ""twist"" isn't creative at all, it's just a solution the writer pulled out of his ass at the end.

Thankfully the fast pace gets us through a lot of the more intricate parts without too much confusion.

I don't think you can get more classic than <i>Star Wars</i>. Considering this was made by an inexperienced director on a relatively small budget in a time when grand space opera sci-fi had never been done on the silver screen before, it's amazing how well this works. George Lucas's greatest strength is his ability to weave a believable and interesting world into a story. In <i>Star Wars</i> we learn about the Empire, the Old Republic, the Senate, the Jedi knights, the Emperor, the Force, the Clone Wars, and a million other little details that make the universe feel believable and alive. And it's never done in a way that feels like an exposition dump. See the first scene with Vader and Tarkin in the Death Star conference room (the one with ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). It tells the audience so much about the world without feeling forced or unnatural.
The costume and set designs are also a strong point. Every piece of machinery, every uniform, every hallway tells a story, and the designs are great all throughout. <i>Star Wars</i> wants to show off a new ship, droid, or costume every few minutes, and they're all unique and interesting.
The writing is pretty good, and the acting is great too. The main cast has excellent chemistry. They even got a decent performance out of Harrison Ford, although he's still the weakest lead. Luke, Han, and Leia are all examples of great characters, with realistic motivations and flaws. I don't know how Disney managed to screw up so badly with the sequels when they have so many examples of great characters to look to in the original trilogy. Leia is also a good example of how to have a strong female character without being a Mary Sue or obviously just pandering to women.
I think people don't give enough credit to the music. I think this is John Williams's best work, and adds so much to the impact of almost every scene.
<i>Star Wars</i> also knows when to show restraint. Luke spends most of the movie just causing problems for everyone else, and never uses a lightsaber in battle. He barely uses the Force, and it's only through other people's help that he's able to succeed in the end. There's also no climactic showdown with Vader. These are all good things, because it leaves time to develop Luke as a character, and allows the first act to be relatively slow and flesh out the world. Contrast this with <i>The Force Awakens</i>, where by the end Rey has mastered the Force, is better than a trained warrior with a lightsaber, and has a climactic showdown with Kylo. There's no room for her to grow as a character, and to fit it all in TFA had to be paced like a squirrel with ADHD.
This isn't to say it's perfect. There are a few things that the plot tries to slide past you without questioning it, like how useless the stormtroopers are at everything. They're not really threatening as an enemy at all. A lot of the special effects were really bad. I can let some things slide because it was 1977, but the explosions looked really pathetic. The duel between Obi-Wan and Vader was stiff and unexciting. Still, <i>Star Wars</i> is a great movie, and Disney fundamentally misunderstood everything that made it great.",,2017-12-22

Basically <a href=""https://boxd.it/mHIZB"">everything I said about the original</a> is also true for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, but this does it all even better. Better set design, better music, better special effects, better story, more world-building, great character development. Vader is really menacing, and a great villain, plus we get a glimpse of the bigger bad (although he doesn't seem very threatening compared to Vader). The pacing is perfect, starting with some good relationship-building scenes which continue into the fantastic battle on Hoth. From there it slowly ramps up to the climactic showdown with Vader, which is executed flawlessly. This really is the best kind of sequel, it uses the original as a leaping-off point to explore new and deeper themes, and expand upon character's relationships and motivations, rather than just wallowing in nostalgia (see <i>The Force Awakens</i> for a perfect example of the latter).
There are still some minor flaws. Shields are confusing. Why could the shield around the Hoth base stop ""any bombardment,"" but not stop ground troops from walking in? The ""I am your father"" reveal is great, but it makes the scene in <i>Star Wars</i> where Obi-Wan tells Luke about his father kind of weird. When every other planet in the galaxy is full of interesting and unique alien life, why is Dagobah just full of normal snakes and lizards? Also, the opening crawl in the original theatrical release said ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" at the beginning, which must have been very confusing to audiences at the time. Especially since the original was just called ""Star Wars,"" and ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" wasn't added until 1981.

A fitting conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy. The magic of the original is still present in the amazing set and costume designs, excellent music, engrossing world. Some of the special effects are really impressive, especially the scenes with the AT-STs and the final space battle. The sheer number of moving parts in some shots is amazing. Luke's confrontation of the Emperor and refusal to kill Vader is such a powerful moment. The ending perfectly completes the development of the main characters, and is a satisfying ending for the plot.
However, <i>Return of the Jedi</i> is definitely the worst of the original trilogy. The opening sequence of rescuing Han seems overly long and convoluted (although it's very enjoyable, the plan just didn't make much sense). With all the amazing and diverse aliens around, why does Jabba just have a normal frog in a cup in his palace? They spent a good chunk of <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and the beginning of this hyping up Boba Fett, and he does look really cool, and then he accomplishes absolutely nothing and literally dies to a blind idiot stumbling around.

First of all, there is way too much terrible CGI, and Jar Jar Binks is unbelievably annoying. Those have been said a million times by everyone and their dog, so I'll move on to my more particular thoughts.
The alien designs range from cool and interesting to ridiculous to thinly-veiled Jewish stereotypes. Likewise, some of the acting is perfectly fine (Liam Neeson was surprisingly good), while some is really atrocious (I generally dislike child actors, but Jake Lloyd was especially bad). Much of the dialogue sounds like it was written by an autistic robot with only a vague grasp on human relationships. On the other hand, I love the ship and set designs. All the new ship designs look cool, and the evolution from these designs to the ships we see in the original trilogy makes sense. 
This movie suffers from sidetrack syndrome. Every simple task has to be sidetracked by a hundred obstacles that pop up at the last minute. They can't fly to Coruscant because the hyperdrive is broken. Then they can't get a new hyperdrive part because the space Jew won't take their money. Then they have to come up with the most ridiculously convoluted plan to make money possible (instead of, say, intimidating or stealing from the space Jew (and don't try to tell me they would have moral qualms about it, they guy owned slaves)). What should have been a simple journey instead ends up taking a third of the film. Most of the plot is driven by sidetracks like this. I'm not saying the pod-racing scene wasn't cool, because it definitely was. It just feels so disconnected from the main plot.
There are a few plot points they hope they can just slide past you without you noticing, like Anakin not having a father. What? His mother just magically got pregnant and gave birth somehow and that's not supposed to be a big deal? We're just supposed to accept it and move on?
I don't like that the Force has been reduced from a mysterious universal energy to a simple number. Midichlorians cheapen the impact of the force.
What's up with the stupid names? Sideous? Really? And not just for characters either. Watto's six-sided die is apparently not a die, it's actually a ""chance cube.""
Darth Maul feels like a non-character. He's just a cheap obstacle thrown in to give the Jedi council a reason to care about Naboo's problems and give the film a climactic boss fight. I don't think he even has a single line of dialogue. Admittedly, the fight with him is really cool. I just wish it hadn't been intercut with Jar Jar's retarded flailing and Anakin literally saving the day by accident.
Now, despite all this, I love the political intrigue elements of the plot, and the world and feel of Star Wars are very present. The authentic world of Star Wars, the ship designs, the mysterious plot, and the action scenes made <i>The Phantom Menace</i> worth it for me.",,2017-12-24

I thought that Jake Lloyd's acting as Anakin in <i>The Phantom Menace</i> was bad, but Hayden Christensen manages to take it to a whole new level of awfulness. I cannot fathom how he was cast in this movie, but at least his performance adds a layer of unintentional hilarity to it. The romance subplot in particular feels incredibly awkward and unnatural because of bad writing and worse acting. On the other side, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee are both great (probably because they're both actually competent actors who have done good movies and theater before).
The CGI was bad in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, but <i>Attack of the Clones</i> also manages to top the wooden, artificial awfulness of its predecessor in that respect as well. They even use CGI for normal sets that they very easily could have actually made, like Palpatine's office. They didn't physically build a single clone trooper costume, they exist only in the computer generated world. Lucas supposedly waited years for the technology to improve enough for him to realize his vision, but perhaps he should have been a little more creative rather than just use CGI as a crutch for anything remotely difficult to film.
One of Star Wars's strengths has always been its costumes, sets, and ship designs. And while the costumes and ships are on point (I really like how you can see the evolution from these clone uniforms, the six-legged walkers, and the old star destroyers, to the equivalents we see in the original trilogy), the set designs are really lacking. The factory scene looked like something out of a video game, and the rest of Geonosis was similarly bland and uninspired. The sets on Tatooine were just copied from other movies, even the Coruscant scenes were pretty bland. At least Kamino looked cool.
I think I haven't complained about the romance subplot enough, so I'll do it some more. Anakin and Padmé have zero chemistry with each other, and their relationship seems so forced. Why was Anakin so obsessed with her? He met her once when he was like 8 years old, and then joined a cult that forbids relationships. I understand that she's hot, and she was nice to him I guess, but it doesn't seem worth it to throw away your whole life's work for that. Also, the way Hayden Christensen ""flirts"" with her is hilariously awkward. The whole thing could have been executed so much better.
There are some cool moments. When the clones finally end up attacking something it's pretty fun, and Obi-Wan playing detective was really cool. The story isn't inherently bad, it's just unpolished and brought down by shitty acting, bad writing, and over-reliance on CGI.",,2017-12-28

I went into <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> with low expectations. Between Star Wars, Alien, Ghost in the Shell, and The Thing (2011), modern successors to science fiction classics have a bad track record. And yet, somehow, this managed to beat the odds and be perhaps the greatest film of 2017 (that I've seen so far). It seems that Denis Villeneuve actually understands what made the original so good, and tried to continue that. The atmosphere, the world, the set designs, the music. These are what made <i>Blade Runner</i> a classic, and Villeneuve clearly appreciated that. But a good sequel should not simply wallow in the delicious juices of the original; it should use the original as a starting point to explore new ideas and themes. And that's what <i>2049</i> does. The atmosphere and world feels like <i>Blade Runner</i>'s, but expands upon what was shown in the original. The music is good and the cinematography is fantastic, and they both evoke a perfect cyberpunk feel that few other films have gotten so right. The set design is phenomenal. I want Wallace's office. It's a rare thing for me to say, but the special effects and CGI were actually really good. The CGI Rachael looked really convincing, so why couldn't <i>Rogue One</i> pull it off with Tarkin or Leia? Anyway, the visuals are a solid 10/10.
The story builds on the original, but doesn't feel formulaic at all. It's still kind of convoluted and open-ended, but nowhere near the degree of the original. The acting was pretty good all around, I especially liked Jared Leto and Sylvia Hoeks. It is kind of amusing how prominent Harrison Ford was in the advertising compared to how insignificant he is in the film, but what can you do. Despite being nearly three hours long, it felt like it was too short. There were plot threads and ideas that I feel didn't get fully explored. Supposedly there's a longer cut, but <a href=""http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/blade-runner/news/a846272/blade-runner-2049-four-hour-cut-wont-be-released/"">Vileneuve said it won't be released</a>. I would definitely be interested in it.
Overall, <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> is a worthy sequel to the original, and one of the very few thirty-years-later continuations of a classic franchise that actually understood why the original was great.",,2017-12-28
2017-12-30,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,2005,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith/,3.5,"Note: This review is for the 2011 Blu-ray release.

<i>""It's treason, then""</i>

It turns out that if you remove the stupid comedy elements (Jar Jar is thankfully not in this movie, and even C-3PO's presence is very minimal), tone down the CGI a bit, and focus on the characters, the prequels could have been good. <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> uses what was good about Episodes I and II (and the original trilogy), and ditches most of what made them bad. The motivations actually make sense, the fights are more dramatic because we actually care about the people involved, the villain is dangerously intelligent and well characterized (I mean Palpatine, not Grievous (fuck that guy, he just comes out of nowhere and then dies because they needed a mid-level boss)). The ship and set designs are some of the best in the series. The opening space battle is my favorite from any Star Wars movie. This is the prequel movie we deserved. I think that if you cut out almost all of <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and all the dumb stuff from <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, Lucas could have easily squeezed it into one movie.
Still, there are several flaws. The CGI and effects in general are better than the other prequels, but they're still pretty bad. Hayden Christensen still can't act (although Ian McDiarmid more than makes up for it, every scene he's in is great). The names are still stupid: Count Dooku, General Grievous, Darth Tyranus, Darth Sidious, etc. And the fact that R2-D2's memory wasn't erased raises a lot of questions. Why the fuck did he never tell Luke ""oh hey, I knew a guy named Skywalker too,"" or the fact that he knew Obi-Wan, or anything else? They could have easily mentioned that both C-3PO and R2-D2 got wiped, but they didn't, and I have no idea why.
Anyway, <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> is still what the prequel trilogy should have been all along.

It may be the worst CG animation from a major studio I've ever seen. The models, textures, and animation are all astoundingly awful. I cannot fathom why they would go with this terrible ""art"" style. I've seriously seen better animation from amateurs with source filmmaker. The voices and personalities of the recurring characters are completely different, and Ahsoka is really irritating. The plot is a mess; if the separatists were planning on killing Jabba anyway, why not just do it right away? The music is really bad, they even messed with the original Star Wars theme enough to ruin it. Any attempt at humor comes across as cringe-worthy, and the rest of the writing is similarly bad.

I'll be judging <i>Jumanji: Welcome to the Unnecessary Subtitle</i> on its own merits.
<i>Jumanji</i> was, as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson would say, ""litty."" I came in expecting nothing but dumb fun, and that's pretty much what I got. Some of the jokes were actually funny, and I enjoyed the escapist fantasy aspect of the plot. The video game logic and references were enjoyable too. The main cast is good, and although the characters are walking stereotypes their interactions were at times amusing. The jokes were hit-or-miss, and it's not exactly high-brow humor. The action scenes weren't very well directed, and the CGI was ugly, but at least it was fun.
Now onto some nitpicks: I don't like how they just completely dropped the main characters real-world problems. Did they get in trouble for not finishing their detention job? I don't know. I like that they established that you keep whatever you had on you when you die before it mattered, but the ability to give other people your lives came out of nowhere. If whoever has the gem can control the animals, why could the villain still control the animals after he lost the gem? And why could Fridge control the elephant but not the jaguars once he had the gem? The villain was actually really lame overall, he's not interesting and they don't even fight him in the end.
Anyway, <i>Jumanji</i> was dumb fun and not much else. I was entertained for two hours, but it's not anything amazing.",theater,2017-12-30

It was made with heart, with so much careful attention paid to casting decisions, making the sets look perfect, making the costumes right, making sure every scene feels right at home in Middle Earth. The special effects are impressive. The tricks used to make the characters appear as different sizes is flawless and never looks unnatural. The CGI isn't very good (it was 2001 after all), but they usually do a good enough job of hiding it.

I'm surprised I hadn't heard more about this one though. Although <i>Hell or High Water</i> concerns a series of bank robberies committed by two brothers in Texas, I wouldn't call it a heist movie. The stakes are kept down-to-Earth and the focus is always narrowly aimed at the characters. And they are great characters, all with realistic motivations, mannerisms, and flaws. Good performances and nice cinematography bring the story to life, and I'll admit the ending had actual emotional impact. While enjoyable and well-executed, the film also didn't really do anything new. I feel like I've seen every part of it somewhere before. It's certainly not unique, but <i>Hell or High Water</i> does what it does very well.",,2018-01-01

As fun as it is to watch bratty kids brutally murder each other, a lot of the early deaths aren't very impactful because we know nothing about the characters. Fortunately, <i>Battle Royale</i> knows not to take itself too seriously. There are moments that look like something straight from an anime (the *teleports behind you, unsheaths katana* bit comes to mind). The low-budget effects and over-the-top action scenes just add to the charm. I also really like the classical music soundtrack. ",,2018-01-02

Sometimes I think that Japan is really just a fictional country that someone made up as a joke. You gotta admire their versatility though. From <i>The End of Evangelion</i>, perhaps the most serious and realistic portrayal of suicidal thoughts, to this, in which high school students jump off of rooftops for fun accompanied by massive splatters of blood.

2018-01-04,Operation Avalanche,2016,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/operation-avalanche/,3.5,"The biggest problem with the theory that the moon landing was faked is that it would be nearly impossible to get hours of uncut footage on film (at 48 fps no less, so it's even longer) without a single scratch or imperfection that would give away the fact that it was shot on film and transferred to digital. And this movie even brings this fact up, but then just moves on without ever answering how they did it.
Anyway, aside of that plot hole, I actually quite liked <i>Operation Avalanche</i>. You can tell this was a passion project for director/star Matt Johnson, which is both a good and a bad thing. On one hand, the attention to detail and energy clearly put into production is great. On the other hand, the main cast look more like excited college students than CIA agents. I like conspiracy theories, even the ones that aren't true, so the plot was fun. The filmmaking elements and the stuff with Kubrick was great too. Making a found-footage film set in the 60s was ambitious, but it definitely paid off, and this is one of the better mockumentaries I've seen. As much as I like Creedence Clearwater Revival, you don't <i>need</i> to include them in every film related to the 60s or the Vietnam War (this one has both ""Bad Moon Rising"" and ""Fortunate Son"").

2018-01-04,Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part I: Beginnings,2012,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/puella-magi-madoka-magica-the-movie/,3,"This is peak Shaft. Join Madoka and her friends in a gorgeous vaguely futuristic city designed by some mad architect for whom functionality, practicality, and even realism take a back seat to looking cool. And apparently whoever designed the classrooms, costumes, stores, hospitals, and CD players in this world also follows the same insane school of design. I thought the original show was swimming in Shaft's style, but this is absolutely saturated with it. That's not a bad thing on its own, the backgrounds and environments look amazing, and the labyrinth sequences are certainly creative and well made. But sometimes it can be distracting, or overdone to the point of being ridiculous.
To compress eight episodes into just over two hours, something would obviously have to be cut. I just can't understand why they would decide to completely cut out Mami's backstory. It makes certain events completely weightless, since we have no idea who she is. The transition from an episodic format messes up a lot of the pacing as well, making a lot of the first half feel rushed. Still, most of the important parts from the show are present, and it's still understandable and sets up the next two movies well.
I've spent the last two paragraphs complaining that <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part I: Beginnings</i> (god that's an awful title; the eleven syllable original title is long enough, but adding two subtitles and a number to it should be illegal or something) is different from the show, so let's talk about why the show was good in the first place. <i>Madoka</i> is Gen Urobuchi doing what he does best: dark fantasy. Well-written characters, a mysterious and dark story, great music and visuals, and cool action sequences made it one of my favorite anime series from the past few years. And this movie still has all those things, plus it benefits from a bigger budget with better animation and art.
My only real problem is that it feels unnecessary. If you haven't seen the show, I'd recommend you watch it for its better pacing. If you have seen the show, then there's no reason to see the movie, since unlike the Eva rebuilds it doesn't try to do anything differently. I'd give the show a 4.5/5, but this movie serve no purpose when the show does the same thing better. It's not bad, in fact it's still pretty good. It's just unnecessary.",,2018-01-04

It doesn't have the pacing issues of the first film, but it still feels really unnecessary when the show exists and is great on its own. I'll admit, the ending still gets me emotional, and I liked that they included a version of the original opening theme, albeit at a totally random moment.

How would Homura dying in the labyrinth save Madoka from the Incubators? If Madoka could destroy the isolation field to escape, why didn't she just do that in the first place? When Homura was fighting Mami, did she shoot herself in the head or not? If so, how did she survive? If not, where did the blood come from? Why, and <b>how</b>, did Homura separate Madoka from Madokami? Why did she not get taken to yuri heaven like everyone else? The third act completely lost me, and then it just ends without resolving anything. I guess they're setting up for a sequel?
As for the movie itself, it looks great. The visuals are amazing, probably better than even the firs two movies, and the music is still great. <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie Part III: Rebellion</i> (still an awful title) is solid from a technical standpoint.
I think that Madoka Magica (the show) had one of the best endings of any anime. It was a perfect end for every character and the plot. A sequel was not needed. This adds nothing to the original, and in fact detracts from the original by making Madoka's sacrifice meaningless.
<i>The End of Evangelion</i> was also a film sequel to a famous anime series that had a very complicated plot and dealt with a lot of the same themes as <i>Rebellion</i>. The reason EoE succeeded was that it felt like a real continuation of the story; it fit in the universe and wrapped up the story perfectly. EoE is the real ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion. <i>Rebellion</i> is something they just tacked onto the end, to continue a story that had already ended.

The music, the writing, the acting, the Wilson brothers, it's all there. Anderson's fetish for symmetry isn't as developed yet, but his love of particular types of shots is evident. Like most Wes Anderson films, the surface level plot quickly takes a backseat to the dynamics and relationships between characters, and that's where <i>Bottle Rocket</i> shines.

2018-01-06,Lolita,1962,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/lolita/,4,"I was wondering what Stanley Kubrick's <i>Lolita</i> would look like if it wasn't restricted by the censorship of its time period, and I think it would probably be a lot like <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>. Even though they were released 37 years apart, the two films have a lot of similarities, especially when it comes to the themes of obsession, jealousy, paranoia, and loyalty.
Although the screenplay was written by Vladimir Nabokov himself, like all of Kubrick's adaptations <i>Lolita</i> is quite different from the source material. However, this was inevitable in the face of the limitations imposed by the censors, so I think the film should be judged on its own without comparison to the novel.
From a technical standpoint, <i>Lolita</i> is excellent. The camerawork is interesting and executed well, the acting is good all around, Peter Sellers is fantastic in every scene he's in, the pacing and editing make the two and a half hour runtime fly by. I love the little expressive details, like Humbert's nervous glances as Charlotte tries to seduce him, and Quilty's shifting eyes. It's also quite humorous at times, I'd probably classify it as a black comedy. I do wish they had been able to explore Humbert and Lolita's relationship a little more.

Alec Guinness plays a blind butler in this movie, and Peter Sellers plays a Chinese detective. That should be sufficient as a recommendation. With a great ensemble cast and a joke or pun with practically every line, <i>Murder by Death</i> is exactly the kind of comedy I love. Like the best parodies, you don't have to be familiar with any particular work it's parodying (see <i>Airplane!</i> for disaster movies in general). Like <i>Clue</i> (1985), <i>Murder by Death</i> plays with and pokes fun at a wide range of mystery and whodunit tropes, with varying degrees of subtlety.

To give you an idea of how crazy this film is, here are just a few of the things involved in it: up-skirt photography as a martial art (complete with a wise old master and a training montage), vending machine vandalism, panty-stealing, male porn actors, a religious cult, incest, cocaine dealing, a woman who convinces a priest to love her by raping him, crossdressing, genital mutilation, emetophilia, crazy kung-fu action, and much, much more. Sion Sono, I hope you know you're the reason everyone thinks Japan is weird. 
At nearly four hours long, <i>Love Exposure</i> is a film about a lot of things: coming of age, acceptance, religion, sex, relationships, and more. But at its core, <i>Love Exposure</i> is a romance. A really weird, exaggerated, and dysfunctional romance, but a romance nonetheless. The length gives plenty of time to develop the characters and let us get to know them, and the pacing is relentless enough to ensure that it's never boring. And when the ending finally comes, it's so satisfying. 
The soundtrack is also quite good. There's a lot of variety between the songs, but they all fit the scenes well. I'm not a big fan of Sono's camerawork. I think he overuses handheld shots, and I dislike the fast cuts in certain scenes. That's really just my personal taste though, as it's clearly a deliberate choice.

It's a classic tale of men's lives being ruined by women and the government for no real reason. The focus is kept on the characters rather than the technology to keep the story relatable (this is where a few Black Mirror episodes have failed).
I do have a few problems with it: They twice try to make you feel bad for the ""cookies,"" after establishing they're not real people, and it doesn't work. If they can surgically copy Joe's brain (presumably against his will, even though he hasn't been convicted of a crime yet (I'll get to that)), why do they need to go through the trouble of making the cookie confess? Can't they just read through his memories that they somehow extracted and digitized? Why did the Joe cookie act like he knew Matt? He was alone in there for five years, then Matt shows up, and he never thinks to question where he is or who Matt is?
And finally, I think that this is the most dystopian world Black Mirror has portrayed yet. Everyone has mandatory, non-removable eye implants that the government can use to instantly and perfectly control what you see and hear. If Matt can use them to look through the eyes of someone else, presumably the government can too (which raises the question of why the confession was necessary again).

Where are the warehouses full of shills who get paid to rate people 5 stars a ton of times?
I do kind of like the technology though, it's a great way to enforce social norms. It would actually be useful for making people be polite in public. I don't agree with giving random security officers the power to distribute huge penalties though.

It always looks terrible when you try to mix the two, you can't have it both ways. The anime-styled 3D CGI look didn't work for Knights of Sidonia, it didn't work for <i>Blame!</i>, and it doesn't work for this. 3D animation can be good if you commit to it, but trying to make it look like 2D just ends up being really janky and terrible. 
With that out of the way, I do actually like the concept of <i>Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters</i> (I guess Netflix is trying to brand this as just <i>Godzilla</i>, with ""Planet of the Monsters"" being the title of ""Part I Ep. 1"", but that's dumb). It's a fresh take on the idea of Godzilla and Kaiju movies in general, and that's always nice. The opening sequence with news footage of the Earth being destroyed by Kaiju, and humans failing to defeat them even with the help of two different species of aliens was really interesting. It also makes me wonder why I'm not watching a movie about that instead. This plot is alright, and it works well enough, but I think the destruction of Earth would have been a more interesting story (especially since this is supposed to be the first in a trilogy).
The monster designs are really terrible, especially Godzilla's, and the mechanical designs remind me of Knights of Sidonia (that's not a good thing). I think Godzilla loses most of his impact without a city to destroy. And what little destruction we get is weakened further by the stiff animation. The characters are good at least, their motivations and actions make sense.
Also, it's kind of kind of weird that now there are three different ongoing Godzilla series that have nothing to do with each other.
Overall, <i>Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters</i> is a resounding meh. While I do appreciate the originality of the concept, it's let down by terrible animation and toothless destruction. I won't spoil it, but the ending alone earned an extra half star.",netflix,2018-01-17

The set designs were pretty good too. But then the show tries to make you hate a guy for hurting fake people in a virtual game world, and it doesn't really work.
I don't really understand how it's possible to recreate someone's entire personality and memories from their DNA. And if he's able to do that, why can't he just rewrite their personality so they enjoy playing Space Fleet or something? He can clearly modify them physically, so why not mentally? In the first scene, they used a 4:3 aspect ratio and intentionally bad effects to make it look more like classic Star Trek, but then they just gave up on that and never use them again in later scenes. Also, they never explain why Daly's personal game was connected to the internet. And you'd think he would at least password protect the omnicorder or something. Furthermore, why not just pause the simulation when he's paused, or when he's not in the game? I also don't understand why an update to the game (why does Daly even have updates enabled for his offline personal copy?) would appear as a wormhole, and why flying into the wormhole would kill them. Why can't he just stop the Callister or remove their faces or turn them into monsters or something before they get to the wormhole?

The eight main characters are a bunch of annoying normies who are bad at communicating (and acting), a problem which frustrates me to no end. Despite all that, I love mysteries like this, and it is set up well. The build up to the premise is executed well, and there are moments that are legitimately spooky and mysterious. And then about halfway into the mystery, when the viewers are just beginning to understand it naturally on their own, a character pulls a book ex machina out of his ass and literally explains exactly what's going on to everyone. From that point on, the pacing goes off the rails, all further plot twists are easy to predict, and I grew increasingly exasperated by the characters. Overall, <i>Coherence</i> was an interesting and creative idea, but it seems like they couldn't think of a good way to communicate it to the viewer.

Sean Connery does a good job as Bond, though obviously I can't compare him to other actors who have portrayed the role yet. He's smooth and clever, and there are a lot of little subtleties that give him more depth, like the way he gets upset at himself for not realizing the coffee would be drugged. The music is fantastic, especially the classic James Bond theme. Some of the effects and editing are janky, the gunshots in particular, but I'm willing to let that slide since the rest of the visuals look fine. Dr. No is a decent villain, but I didn't really understand his motivations. Also, the middle act felt like it went on far too long, accomplishing nothing, and then the final act ended too quick. Bond just stumbles onto a way to solve the problem by accident, and that's it. Still, <i>Dr. No</i> is enjoyable and entertaining, even if it doesn't do anything particularly unique.",007 marathon,2018-02-01

It's also really obvious that they tried to recapture what made ""White Christmas"" good, but they totally missed the point. ""White Christmas"" worked because it had interesting characters that you really cared about. The characters in ""Black Museum"" were cheesy and overly exaggerated.

The plot gets lost in the middle as it wanders around subplots that don't really matter. As nice as the Gypsy dancers were, they were completely unnecessary to the story.

Even though <i>Goldfinger</i> is only the third James Bond film, it seems to have perfectly developed a winning formula complete with all the fun tropes and oft-parodied cliches associated with Agent 007. A good mix of gadgets, girls, and guile take James Bond through an array of interesting locations and set pieces, uncovering a cartoonishly creative plot to destroy the west (and make a lot of money). The titular Goldfinger makes for an interesting villain, with realistic motivations despite his other cliched traits. The new music is great, and I enjoyed the brief inclusion of the original James Bond theme. 
There are a few flaws, however. I like Goldfinger as a villain, but he has a bad habit of explaining his plans. What was the point of the elaborate explanation of Operation Grand Slam, complete with models and maps, to people he was planning on killing five minutes later? And there were many times where he could have easily killed Bond, but chose not to for some contrived reason. Also, this film features a character unironically named ""Pussy Galore.""

Objectively, none of the movies have been great on their own, and the overarching plot is paper-thin. You have to admire their marketing though. <i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> had been in development since 2012, and was originally set to be released on February 24th of last year, then was delayed until October of 2017, then was delayed again to February 2nd, 2018, then was delayed <i>again</i> until April 20, 2018. And then they just released it out of nowhere on February 4th, 2018. Keep in mind that up until the day of its release there was no trailer, no production photos, and not even an official title. Supposedly the fourth film is scheduled for October 2018, so it'll probably actually be released in 2020. I do worry about the future of the franchise's naming convention though. There's only so many titles you can squeeze out of word like ""Cloverfield.""
Anyway, onto the film itself. Cloverfield movies have never been shy with cliches, but <i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> seems to enjoy wallowing in predictability more than the other two. Nearly every ""spooky disaster in space"" trope shows up at some point, most without even the courtesy of a handwave explanation. Why did the worms do that thing? Why did the magnets attack the guy? Why did the wall eat the guy's arm? I don't know, I guess quantum physics are basically magic.
This third film also returns to its roots with a terrible main character. However, unlike <i>Cloverfield</i>, this movie's main character isn't annoying, she's just boring. Every other character on the space station is more interesting than Ava, and it always feels like she's just a plot device along for the ride, rather than being a human being with agency.
The writing is just a mess, events happening for no discernible reason purely to keep the plot moving. There's also a completely unnecessary subplot about some random pleb on Earth, which could have easily been removed with no detriment to the film.
<i>The Cloverfield Paradox</i> wasn't all bad, there were some genuinely suspenseful and mysterious moments in the first half (oh yeah, that's why I like Cloverfield movies). But it wasn't enough to carry the film through its abysmal second half. Maybe <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_(2018_film)"">the next film</a> will recapture the suspenseful thriller aspect of <i>10 Cloverfield Lane</i> and save the franchise, but I won't get my hopes up.",netflix,2018-02-05

With a longer runtime, a bigger budget, and a much more expansive scope, <i>Thunderball</i> aims to take the James Bond franchise up a level. And it succeeds in some ways. <i>Thunderball</i> boasts a great villain (with an evil eyepatch and pool full of sharks, naturally), awesome new gadgets (jetpacks will never not be cool), creative underwater fight scenes, and more Bond girls than ever before. The plot is straightforward and engaging, but I feel like it takes way too long to get going. There are a lot of extraneous subplots and scenes that could have been cut down considerably. The underwater scenes are certainly cool, but they tend to go very slowly, which screws with the pacing. Some of the characters are poorly fleshed out, and some of the special effects are cheesy, but it's still a James Bond film at heart. The music and one-liners are on point, and overall <i>Thunderball</i> is still a fun spy thriller.",007 marathon,2018-02-05

<i>""Listen, you can't shoot me! I, uh, I have a very low threshold of death. My doctor says I can't have bullets enter my body at any time.""</i> - Jimmy Bond

<i>Casino Royale</i> is a mess in almost every way. The script was worked on by at least ten different people and rewritten many times, and yet the plot is still nearly incomprehensible. The film drags on for far too long, and there are way too many characters with no real purpose in the plot. Each of the five distinct parts was directed by a different person, and the guy who was tasked with splicing it all together didn't want to be credited as ""Co-ordinating Director"" because even he knew it was a mess. There was some kind of dramatic feud between Peter Sellers and Orson Welles which ended with Sellers either walking out on the production or being fired. It isn't serious enough to be a straight spy thriller, and it's not funny enough to be a satirical comedy, so it's just a big bland mess.
It's really a shame though, because <i>Casino Royale</i> had a lot going for it. The music is really great, it has an all star cast including Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, David Niven, Orson Welles, and Woody Allen, some of the sets are quite cool, and some of the comedy is really funny.

<i>American Psycho</i> is one of the few movies I've seen that just works perfectly on every level. If you turn off your brain and just view it as a dark comedy about Christian Bale being insane and killing people, it's excellent. If you delve deeper and look at it as a look through the eyes of a deeply mentally disturbed individual struggling to control his murderous sexual urges, it's excellent. If you delve even deeper and see it as a commentary on the uncaring, unfeeling, self-absorbed world of the business elite, it's excellent. It works on every level, never failing to be both entertaining and thought provoking. The writing is perfect, Christian Bale’s performance is amazing, the visuals and music are great, and <i>American Psycho</i> is just an all-around perfect movie.
Now for some analysis. Patrick Bateman is the personification of late 80s materialism. He quotes album reviews and restaurant critics verbatim, and his entire personality is based on brands and products. In his opening monologue, we learn where he lives before we even learn his name. The only thing that scares Bateman in the movie is the realization that Paul Allen's apartment is nicer than his. He is the ultimate consumer, to the point that he literally <i>consumes</i> people. But he is not unique in this. Everyone at Pierce & Pierce dresses the same, talks the same, and buys the same things. They all do nothing at work but go out to lunch and show off their business cards. Bateman is a kind of sociopathic alien outsider, observing the world of the ultra-rich and simply trying to copy it. As he tells Evelyn, his supposed fiancé, “I want to fit in.” He does all the same things as Bryce, Van Patten, and McDermott, he just takes it a little too far. Everyone is so self-absorbed, only focused on themselves and their own life, that they don’t notice what’s going on around them. Because everyone just wants to “fit in,” they all end up looking identical. In the first scene, Bryce mistakes someone else for Paul Allen. Allen mistakes Bateman for Halberstram. A Stephen Hughes claimed he saw Allen at a restaurant in London, but “he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul.” The real Marcus Halberstram claimed he had dinner with Bateman on the night of Paul’s disappearance, but he was mistaken. Harold Carnes (the lawyer) mistakes Bateman for someone named Davis. No one can tell anyone apart, and they don’t really care. No one in the film (except maybe Jean) cares about anything but themselves. Bateman confesses four times to people, and all four times they either weren’t listening or didn’t believe him. Carnes says he had lunch with Paul Allen in London, but he was probably mistaken, again. The realtor at the end must have found Paul’s apartment in the condition Bateman left it in, but she just cleaned it up and sold it. Patrick Bateman gets away with the murders not because he’s a criminal mastermind, but because everyone else it too selfish to care, and that is the point of <i>American Psycho</i>.",beta,2018-02-09

While I appreciate that they're constantly trying to mix up the formula and do something new with the James Bond franchise, <i>You Only Live Twice</i> is definitely more goofy than the previous Bond films. James Bond ""becomes Japanese,"" and then becomes a ninja, and then attacks a secret SPECTRE base inside of a volcano with an army of ninjas. It's silly, and the tone is much lighter than the other films (perhaps to be expected with a screenplay by Roald Dahl), but it still works. Sean Connery is visibly growing tired of the role, and his performance is noticeably worse because of it. It's almost as if he meant for this to be his last one. Bond's ability to instantly seduce women is getting to be frankly ridiculous. There are some great action sequences, including the aerial helicopter fight and the big battle at the end. And the set design is great, I love the MI6 submarine and the volcano base (I can see that <i>The Incredibles</i> took inspiration from this set, along with the Bond theme music).

First thing's first: Sean Connery was a better Bond than George Lazenby. Lazenby lacks a certain cool collectedness, and his acting is often subpar. He's not bad, but Connery was definitely better. With that out of the way, <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i> was still pretty good. I like that the franchise is constantly evolving and changing to keep it from getting stale. The lengthy undercover segment and distinct lack of gadgets are refreshing for the series. The skiing segment is really impressive and cool, making it one of the most exciting action sequences of the franchise. As usual, the set designs and music are on point. The relationship between Bond and Tracy feels very forced, probably because she disappears for the entire middle act. Telly Savalas is great as Ernst Blofeld, he makes an intimidating and charismatic villain.

Unfortunately, it seems they were so busy putting in action and comedy sequences that they forgot to add a plot. By the end I had no idea who was working for who or what anyone's motivations were. The story involved diamonds, space lasers, body doubles, random gay guys, and lesbian acrobats, but how those are connected I can only guess. There are a zillion characters that could have been interesting if they were given more time to develop. The plot is just a convoluted mess of characters and locations, all just to move along to different extravagant set pieces.

As much as I liked Sean Connery as Bond, perhaps it was time to move on. Roger Moore does a great job as James Bond, keeping the elements we know and love while also putting his own spin on the character. Similarly, the plot keeps most of the classic Bond elements while exploring new ground. The voodoo theme, Louisiana setting, and absence of Blofeld and SPECTRE are refreshing to a franchise that was starting to get stale. <i>Live and Let Die</i> also has the benefit of the best music of any James Bond film to date, especially the stellar opening song. Mr. Big is a great villain for many reasons. He's unique, stylish, has interesting henchmen, and (perhaps most importantly) has a plan that might actually work. But don't let that fool you, <i>Live and Let Die</i> still has a certain degree of goofiness, including Roger Moore using live crocodiles as a bridge and a character blowing up like a balloon and popping. On the other hand, it also has some great action sequences. The boat chase is exciting and hilarious, and demonstrates how this series continues to one-up itself at every turn.

The best adjective I can think of to describe <i>mother!</i> is ""engaging."" I was certainly engaged while watching it. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. This is the kind of movie I love to watch, where you have to constantly examine every frame for hidden symbolism, and the surface plot can mostly just be ignored. Most importantly, I had no idea where it was going to go. <i>mother!</i> is one of the rare films where I had no clue how it was going to end right up until it did. And that's what makes it enjoyable, the worst thing a movie can be is ""predictable.""
So it was certainly engaging, but was it good? I think so. I can respect a film that sets bizarre rules for itself and then sticks to them. There is absolutely no music. None of the characters have names. Every single shot is a shot of Jennifer Lawrence—most of them being closeups—or a shot from her point of view. All the camerawork is handheld. All this adds to the atmosphere of the film, and almost makes it feel like a first-person movie from Jennifer Lawrence's perspective.
Most of the acting is pretty good, the set design is great, and the sound design, while a little unconventional (all the sound effects are way too loud) adds to the feel of the film. But the story is the interesting part. It's wrapped in so many layers of symbolism and allegory that I don't even know where to begin unraveling it all. There are a lot of biblical references, but not in the conventional way of just retelling a Bible story with a different setting. I do think Darren Aronofsky is trying to say something with <i>mother!</i>, but I don't know what. Maybe after I think about it more and rewatch it I'll understand more.
Either way, <i>mother!</i> is an engaging and unpredictable roller coaster of a film, with some interesting themes and a unique style. Definitely worth a watch.","fc, beta",2018-02-17

I think we've reached the point where the James Bond franchise has decided to embrace the goofiness and just run with it. Christopher Lee plays a three-nippled assassin with a dwarf sidekick, that should be sufficient as an endorsement of this film.
Roger Moore is getting used to the role of Bond, and his acting is growing on me too. Christopher Lee is great as always, making Scaramanga a charismatic and memorable villain. Clifton James returns, hilariously, as Sheriff J.W. Pepper. The slanted MI6 office in the shipwreck is a cool set, as is Scaramanga's island home. Unfortunately, <i>The Man with the Golden Gun</i> is dragged down considerably by its first two acts. The plot doesn't make a lot of sense. Hai Fat had no real reason not to have Bond killed right away. While the kung fu fight choreography was cool, I think the whole thing was contrived just to get an excuse to use it. Also, Bond solves most of the conflicts purely by luck, or someone else just does it for him.

Alright, I'll admit it, Roger Moore is a pretty great Bond. I can't decide if he's better than Sean Connery, but he's definitely good.
<i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> takes elements from lots of previous Bond movies, but manages to do them better. From <i>You Only Live Twice</i> we get the eccentric villain with an exotic lair capturing American and Russian space/sea vessels, only this time the villain isn't <i>as</i> dumb, and an oil tanker capturing submarines makes more sense than a spaceship that eats other spaceships. From <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i> we get an excellent skiing action scene, this time with better effects and action, and a really cool stunt at the end. From <i>Thunderball</i> we get underwater action scenes and sharks, but less slow and with the addition of a submarine car. It's also nice to have a Bond girl who does more than just look good for once. Barbara Bach's performance as Russian Major Anya Amasova isn't great, but she has good chemistry with Bond and their rivalry is fun to watch. The set designs, music, and gadgets are all top notch. I especially love Stromberg's submersible base, and the aforementioned submarine car. Jaws is a cool and imposing villain, in contrast to many of the unintimidating minor villains from previous Bond films. The one liners are creative, and in general the humor was well done throughout.
<i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> doesn't take itself too seriously, but at times it can be a little too over the top and cheesy.

That skydiving section at the beginning was actually really impressive, probably one of the coolest action scenes from a James Bond film yet. However, what follows is a series of utterly pointless contrivances in pathetic attempts to create cool scenes. I feel like someone at the planning meeting just came up with a bunch of ideas he thought would be interesting (hey, centrifuges are cool, what if the villain tries to kill Bond with one? And everyone liked Jaws from <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>, let's have him back. And what if later Bond pretends to be shooting at a pheasant but really he's taking out an assassin? Or what if he had a hovercraft disguised as a gondola? Wouldn't that be cool?), and then the rest of the writers had to think of more and more elaborate ways to shoehorn those ideas into the plot. The whole thing is an incoherent mess, with no consistency or logic. Things just happen because they would make for a good scene, not for any in-universe reason. Many of the individual scenes are interesting, but as a whole they make up a bland, nonsensical mess. The tone is all over the place, much of the acting is lifeless, and every element of the plot is either copied from previous Bond films or just really stupid.
It's a shame, because the cinematography is actually pretty good, especially in the aforementioned skydiving scene, and the scene with Corinne and the dogs (even though that one was weirdly over-dramatic). Overall, <i>Moonraker</i> seems more like a dumb cash grab than a legitimate successor to the James Bond franchise.

This definitely has the most baffling opening sequence of any Bond film so far. After a supposedly emotional scene where Bond visits the grave of his dead wife (who hasn't been mentioned since <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>, and isn't brought up again in this movie), we cut very quickly to a wacky comedic action scene in which someone who I can only assume is Blofeld is killed in a ridiculous and anticlimactic way. Cool helicopter stunts though.
After the opening credits, the rest of <i>For Your Eyes Only</i> is kind of formulaic and doesn't really do anything new for the series, but it's still generally entertaining. This has the third ski chase scene of the franchise, and while it's still cool I'm beginning to grow tired of them. The tone is more serious than Moore's previous films, but it's still quite goofy in some parts (especially the opening). The gadgets are scaled back, the villain's plan is a little more sensible, and the story is a lot more sane. The plot makes sense in the beginning, but quickly descends into more loosely connected random action scenes.
The absence of Bernard Lee as M is very very noticeable, and sad. He was one of the few recurring factors through all the Bond films, and I doubt anyone will be able to portray the role as well as he did. Fortunately Lois Maxwell's Miss Moneypenny and Desmond Llewelyn's Q return, and they're both fantastic even though they're starting to get old. I always appreciate Q's annoyed cooperation with Bond, and they have some great moments together in this.
The villain isn't very interesting, and honestly I'm getting tired of villains in this series coming up with ridiculously theatrical ways to kill Bond instead of just shooting him. And this is a really minor complaint, but the theme song was super lame.

The blandness of <i>For Your Eyes Only</i> meets the silliness of <i>Moonraker</i>. <i>Octopussy</i> is notable for having a ridiculous name, and not much else. The plot is more serious this time, based on a staged accidental nuclear attack which would theoretically lead to NATO disarmament, but it's impossible to take seriously amidst the circus shenanigans, gorilla suit, and vine-swinging Tarzan screams. It has some entertaining and funny moments, like the Indian car chase scene, but it feels like a parody of James Bond films more than an actual continuation of the franchise. I don't know who decided that James Bond plots don't need to make sense any more, but they should be fired. The Louis Jourdan's performance as Kamal is alright, but he never feels threatening. Roger Moore is starting to get too old for his role, as is Lois Maxwell. M returns after being absent from <i>For Your Eyes Only</i>, now played by Robert Brown. He's not bad, but can't be the same as Bernard Lee. Desmond Llewelyn's Q has a bigger role than usual, which is greatly appreciated, as his interactions with Bond are always entertaining.

An excellent dark comedy about the behind-the-scenes scheming, plotting, and backstabbing that occurred in the wake of Stalin's death. I have to give Armando Iannucci for making a relatively apolitical film about political intrigue. There are no good guys in this film, just powerful individuals trying to come out on top with no regard for the millions of citizens they supposedly govern. The costume and set designs are very high quality, which I always appreciate. Some great performances by Steve Buscemi as Nikita Krushchev, Simon Russell Beale as Lavrentiy Beria, and Jason Isaacs as General Georgy Zhukov make for some really humorous scenes, as well as some more serious ones.

Due to some kind of legal shenanigans, Kevin McClory (one of the writers of the original <i>Thunderball</i>) ended up with the rights to that story, and decided to make his own remake of it 18 years later. Sean Connery returns again as James Bond, for the last time, for real this time (at least so far), and I must say I kind of missed him. He's definitely too old for the role, but he still makes it work, and seems to be having fun at least. The plot is mostly a retread of <i>Thunderball</i>, which makes the whole thing boring and predictable. Thankfully there are fewer slow underwater segments, but they could have done a lot more to reinterpret the story in a new and interesting way. All of the recast recurring characters (M, Q, Felix Leiter, Miss Moneypenny, and Blofeld) are far weaker than their Eon counterparts. I do like Klaus Maria Brandauer’s Largo better than the <i>Thunderball</i> version though. <i>Never Say Never Again</i> has a more serious tone and less campy humor than the contemporary Eon films, which in my opinion makes it better than <i>Octopussy</i>, the other Bond film released in 1983. I do feel that it's let down by the absence of the classic James Bond gun barrel opening, the theme song, and the recurring actors from the Eon series. Overall, <i>Never Say Never Again</i> is slightly better than <i>Octopussy</i>, but since it's not part of the mainline series and the plot is the same as <i>Thunderball</i> there's no real point in watching it (unless you just really want to see Sean Connery as James Bond one more time).",007 marathon,2018-03-04

<i>Get Out</i> was really disappointing to me, because somewhere beneath all the race baiting and political bullshit there's the core of what could have been a decent suspense/thriller movie. But instead of focusing on those aspects, <i>Get Out</i> tries to be some kind of anti-racism statement, at the expense of being a good movie. Literally every conversation in this entire film is about race. Every single one. It's very tiring and frankly insulting. Yeah, screw those evil racist whites, they're just jealous of black peoples' superior strength, speed, sexual prowess, and coolness. They even throw in a jab at racist white cops too. This racism narrative has been done to death in modern cinema. And the story would have worked fine without the race angle. Make it about old people wanting to steal the bodies of young, able people. Nope, everything has to be about race now.
Besides that, <i>Get Out</i> is very competently made. The cinematography is pretty nice, and the music builds the suspense well. The acting was good from all of the main cast, and the set designs were nice too. The comic relief friend character, Rod, was one of the best parts of the movie. The plot could have been interesting if it wasn't so focused on race. But on the other hand, if this was just a competently made thriller (it's listed as ""horror,"" but it's really not), no one would be talking about it, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten four Academy Award nominations.
There are also a few plot annoyances. Why did Walter sprint at Chris the first night? Was it just to creep the audience out? I implore you, dear reader, to try sticking tiny bits of cotton in your ears and seeing how much it actually impairs your hearing. I'll give you a hint: not very much. And Chris turns from a fairly average guy into an action movie hero who barely finches at getting a letter opener stabbed through his hand in about three seconds flat. And when the cops finally do show up to the Armitage property and find it burned to the ground with two people dead from gunshot wounds and Chris's fingerprints all over the place, with him having no believable explanation for what happened, he's definitely going to prison.",,2018-03-04

Okay, first of all, <i>A View to a Kill</i> is a stupid title. <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/41119/what-does-a-view-to-a-kill-mean"">Apparently</a> it comes from a foxhunting song, but that doesn't provide any more logic to it. Anyway, I think James Bond films are best when they're taking the same formula in a new direction, using the world of 007 as a backdrop for exploring new ideas and themes. They're at their worst when they just wallow in the formula, going through the motions without providing anything new. And I feel that the last few Bond movies have been doing that. As such, each sequel feels more like a chore to sit through than something exciting. <i>A View to a Kill</i> takes a few steps to differentiate itself, but ultimately falls into the same rhythm as countless other Bond films.
I guess skiing action scenes are just a thing that James Bond films do now. Again, this one is still kind of cool, but can't we have a surfing chase scene or something just to mix it up?
The plot is pretty generic for the series, but at least it mostly makes sense this time. However, I think the entire first hour about horse racing is only very loosely connected to the second half, and could be cut down considerably. One of the best things this film does is pair up James Bond with another agent, Sir Godfrey Tibbett (played by Patrick Macnee) to work with. They have great chemistry together, and it's nice to see 007 working with another MI6 agent for once.
Another strong point is the villain, Max Zorin, played by Christopher Walken. Walken gives a great performance, and makes Zorin a cool and memorable villain, even though his plan is kind of ridiculous.
Aside from Tibbett, all the other side characters are very poorly fleshed out. Grace Jones's May Day is an interesting character, but her acting is terrible and her death is pointless. Stacey Sutton is just screamy and annoying. CIA agent Chuck Lee shows up and then immediately disappears for the rest of the plot. And Zorin's henchmen are all so forgettable I don't even remember their names.
Roger Moore still has his natural charm, and he seems to still be having fun with the role, but every time his character has to do anything remotely physical it makes it painfully obvious that Moore is too old for the role.

A refreshing change of pace compared to Roger Moore's last few Bond films, <i>The Living Daylights</i> introduces Timothy Dalton as James Bond 007 with a much darker, more serious plot. Characters are better fleshed out, the campy tone is gone, the villains have realistic motives, and the plot actually makes sense! Similar to <i>A View to a Kill</i>, Bond is paired up with another agent for the first act of <i>The Living Daylights</i>, although this relationship is much less friendly.  It makes for some interesting interactions, and Bond playing off of another MI6 agent is certainly humorous. I immediately liked Timothy Dalton, he's younger, more physical, and more serious than Roger Moore, and I like his interpretation of the character a lot. I'm glad they tried a more serious take on the romance subplot, something that the series has been missing for a long time, but I never really liked Kara Milovy enough to care about her relationship with Bond. I don't like the new Miss Moneypenny, Caroline Bliss, but it could just be because I was so used to Lois Maxwell's excellent portrayal of the character. The double crossing cold war plot, and realistic villains are a nice change from the insane schemes of previous villains that seemed to be straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. Overall, <i>The Living Daylights</i> is definitely taking the franchise in a good direction, but it's still bogged down with an overly complicated plot. There are way too many characters, locations, and subplots. A tighter story would help improve these movies a lot.

The ultimate late night film. But don't worry, the lightning fast pacing will keep you awake. The plot moves from scene to scene so fast you barely have time to process it, and there's some unique camerawork used to keep the pace up.
The plot is an absurd descent into surreality over the course of a single night as a humble word processor struggles to get home in New York City. I noticed some symbolic parallels to <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, but I'd have to rewatch it before I wrote anything substantial on that.
The story is carried by some very good performances from the whole cast. Griffin Dunne plays our main character, Paul Hackett, very well. He's a very relatable figure, the kind of guy who you catch yourself acting like, even if you didn't mean to.
The music is also excellent. The transition from classical pieces (and I'm disappointed in myself that I recognized Bach's ""Air on the G String"" as ""that song from <i>The End of Evangelion</i>"" first, and as an actual piece of classical music second) to more weird, modern, obscure songs matches the plot's transition from the mundane to the bizarre.

Once again, taking the James Bond franchise in a new direction pays off! <i>Licence to Kill</i> is a much darker, more serious, and more violent film than any of the previous, and it works really well. It's a story of revenge, with Bond left (mostly) on his own without the help of MI6. The movie sets its own tone and defies predictability by playing with more adult themes and a more serious story.
The villain, similar to Koskov and Whitaker from <i>The Living Daylights</i>, is a more realistic enemy, whose motivations are simply lots of money, rather than world domination. Robert Davi does a decent job as Franz Sanchez, and while he isn't the most memorable Bond villain he fits the story well.
Pam Bouvier also makes for a different Bond girl, who acts as a an integral piece of the plot rather than just window dressing. She's strong willed and can actually hold her own in a fight, which is a refreshing change from the typical screamy damsels 007 has to deal with.
There are several great action scenes too (and no skiing this time, hooray!). The stunts are elaborate, and destruction is visceral, and the violence is noticeably turned up a notch.
Q also has a much larger role than usual. He's great as always, and adds some levity that otherwise <i>Licence to Kill</i> would be lacking. However, I am realizing that Desmond Llewelyn is getting old, and the Bond franchise just won't be the same without him.
Timothy Dalton has definitely proven himself capable of being a great Bond actor. As much as I liked Roger Moore, Dalton is a lot more physical and emotional, and developed a unique personality for his character.

This is the first Bond film to really feel ""modern"" to me, probably because of the six year gap since the last one. <i>GoldenEye</i> brings the James Bond franchise boldly into the 1990s exactly as you'd expect: with an ex-USSR superweapon, a shiny new gun barrel opening, a new actor for Bond, a female M, a focus on hacking and the internet, and some shitty CGI. 
Firstly, dear god, what did they do the soundtrack? Every other 007 score has at least been decent, but this one is downright offensive. They even had to go and ruin the classic James Bond theme!
Secondly, dear god, what did they do to James Bond? I really do not like Pierce Brosnan. His acting is all over the place, and he's just too soft spoken and lacks the charisma needed to play Bond. Timothy Dalton instantly had a distinct and memorable personality for his Bond, I feel like Brosnan didn't know what he wanted to do with the character. I never grew up watching Pierce Brosnan's Bond, so I have no nostalgia for his performance.
Fortunately, some of the changes are good. <i>GoldenEye</i> takes the impressive action set pieces from the past two films and combines them with a plot more similar to the older movies. We've got a charismatic megalomaniac using a Soviet superweapon from his secret Cuban base to steal millions of dollars and destroy the world financial system. This is the kind of stuff the Bond franchise was built on.
The action scenes really are impressive, as are the set designs. The tank car chase, base jumping into a plummeting plane, even Bond's fistfight with 006 near the climax. The Soviet base in the opening, the giant hidden satellite dish, and Sean Bean's command center are all excellent sets, paying heed to the early days of island mansions and volcano lairs. (A side note, the creators of Just Cause 2 obviously loved this movie).
Basically all the characters besides Bond are done well. I actually like Judi Dench's M, although she'll never compare to Bernard Lee. Sean Bean plays an excellent villain, oozing creepiness and charisma, and totally overshadowing Bond in every scene they're in together. However, I'm a little upset that the opening credits spoil the fact that he survived. Xenia Onatop is an interesting and eccentric villain. Natalya is another strong Bond girl, and her skills actually make sense for her background for once.
So I'm conflicted about GoldenEye. It's somewhat of a return to formula after Timothy Dalton's two films, and Pierce Brosnan is probably my least favorite Bond to date, but the great action scenes and side characters still manage to redeem it.",007 marathon,2018-03-06

From all of their little idiosyncrasies, the particular phrases they use, and even the way they move I feel like these are real people with lives I have gotten to see a tiny slice of.

Okay, so Pierce Brosnan isn't completely terrible. He seems a lot more comfortable in the role of Bond compared to how he was in <i>GoldenEye</i>. He's still just sort of bland and uninteresting though.
As far as the plot goes, it's a mashup of all the classic Bond tropes: eccentric villain with a cool lair (this time as a boat!) and a god complex, stolen nuclear missiles, attractive female sidekick, false flag attacks, something about satellites, scuba diving, etc. Jonathan Pryce does a great job as our villain, Elliot Carver, a Rupert Murdoch/Steve Jobs type with the crazy turned up to 100. He's definitely hammy, but his character is kind of inherently cartoonishly evil, so it's all part of the fun. The part where he mocks Wai Lin's kung fu is hilarious though.
Speaking of Wai Lin, she's a great sidekick character, and she and Bond play off each other well. Their relationship even unfolds over time, rather than being instantly seduced by Bond like Carver's wife. Most of the other characters are so forgettable I won't even mention them.
Desmond Llewelyn is still rocking it as Q, even 34 years after his first appearance in the role. Judi Dench and Samantha Bond are alright as M and Miss Moneypenny, and I particularly like Joe Don Baker's CIA agent Jack Wade (what happened to Felix Leiter though?).
One of the worst parts of <i>GoldenEye</i> was the soundtrack, and thankfully they moved away from that to a more generic (but not bad) score.
However, the action scenes are a notable step down from <i>GoldenEye</i>. With the exception of the helicopter/motorcycle chase, all the action scenes were poorly choreographed and badly shot. The fast cuts make is difficult to tell what's going on, and the punches really feel weightless.

<i>Burn After Reading</i> has a great ensemble cast, with good performances from George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, John Malkovich, and J.K.

It starts off as a fairly standard comedy with a few marginally funny moments, but takes a pretty drastic turn about halfway through that I did not see coming. It's only really funny near the end, when all the threads start coming together to form some kind of nonsensical, ridiculous whole.

It took a little while to find its stride, but <i>In the Loop</i> may be one of the funniest political satires I've seen. As in Armando Ianucci's later film, <i>The Death of Stalin</i>, he perfectly walks the fine line of poking fun at a political situation without taking a side. The writing is brilliant, with nearly every other line being a clever witticism or a creative insult. The dialogue is so hilarious and lightning fast that sometimes it's difficult to catch everything that's going on. The characters are also a strong point, all of them being unique caricatures who play off each other in interesting ways. There are also some great performances from the whole cast. Peter Capaldi is great, but the standout to me was James Gandolfini, who just seemed to be having so much fun with his role as American General George Miller. The messy handheld camerawork gives an air of mockumentary newscast to the whole thing, and it mostly works, but can get annoying at times. Overall, <i>In the Loop</i>'s clever writing and fun characters make it a very enjoyable political satire.",,2018-03-08

<i>“I thought Christmas only comes once a year.""</i>

This plot is actually quite a departure from formula, with some unexpected twists and turns, and one of the most interesting villains the series has had. Usually, James Bond films do well when they try new things, but it didn't quite work for <i>The World Is Not Enough</i>.
First of all, Elektra King. A really great character, with some unique relationships with all the main characters, portrayed excellently by Sophie Marceau. I seriously didn't see her betrayal coming, which says a lot in a series as predictable as this. Her final scene with Bond is really emotional, and would have been a fantastic way to end the film. Unfortunately there's another pointless scene after it.
I don't really understand her plan though. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like she went to excessive lengths, including trying to kill millions of people, just for fame and money from her oil pipeline?
Anyway, her co-villain/henchman Renard is a classic case of cool idea, poor execution. He's introduced as this famous international terrorist, living on borrowed time and unable to feel pain due to a bullet being lodged in his brain. That's so cool, a villain with nothing to lose who can't feel pain! And then it's brought up like once as a gimmick, and doesn't matter to the plot at all. He could have just been some average schmuck as far as the plot is concerned.
The obligatory love interest, Christmas Jones, a supposed nuclear scientist, is quite attractive but totally unnecessary. It seems her entire purpose is so that we can end the movie with a sex scene, and that amazing line I started the review with.
Judi Dench, Samantha Bond, and Desmond Llewelyn return as M, Miss Moneypenny, and Q, and they're all pretty good. I like that M has a bigger role in this, it's nice to see her actually doing something instead of just coordinating everything behind the scenes. And I must say a very sad farewell to Desmond Llewelyn, the series will never be the same without him. ""Always have an escape plan"" indeed.
The opening boat chase and the helicopter buzzsaw scene (although it makes absolutely no sense) are great action set pieces, Unfortunately the rest of the action scenes are mediocre at best, including <i>yet another</i> ski chase. I have nothing against skiing, and some of these scenes have been good, but can we please try something different for a change?
Pierce Brosnan has been steadily improving, and his acting here is actually decent. He's still my least favorite Bond though.

Well that was pretty atrocious. Let's get the few good points out of the way, and then move on to the bad.
The sword fight was cool. Rosamund Pike was good. Gustav Graves had some fun moments. That's about it.
Now for all the bad stuff. Gone are the days of detailed miniatures and practical effects; everything is shitty CGI now. Even simple things like buildings and planes are done in CGI instead of making physical miniatures. I can only attribute this choice to laziness, and it looks awful.
The plot is a mess. It starts really promising: Bond is captured by the North Koreans after a surprisingly decent action scene, and tortured for over a year! He's finally rescued by MI6, but they revoke his double-0 status and take him off duty! He has to escape from his own people and save the day on his own! It could have been great, with Bond as a broken man, betrayed by his own country and totally on his own a la <i>License to Kill</i>. Instead they drop that whole thread in about three seconds. After surviving 14 months of torture Bond is completely back to normal after a shave and a haircut. MI6 continues to help him for some reason that wasn't adequately explained. I'm not totally sure what the villain's plan was, but surely there would be an easier way of achieving it than building a massive satellite-based death ray using diamonds to reflect the power of the sun (hey, <a href=""https://boxd.it/oHOuR"">doesn't that sound familiar?</a>). The tone is way too campy and ridiculous. This film features invisible cars, a space laser controlled by a Nintendo power glove, an ice palace, ""DNA replacement therapy"" that can change your race, and all kinds of other stupid things. The James Bond franchise has always played it fast and loose with science, but <i>Die Another Day</i> is really pushing it. The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese if you think about it at all (why didn't they just shoot a bunch of missiles at Icarus while it was burning up the minefield? Why didn't Frost just shoot Jinx instead of trying to drown her? etc.)
A lot of the acting is really bad, and somehow Pierce Brosnan is already looking really old. I like him as a person, but he doesn't make a good Bond. John Cleese is nothing compared to Desmond Llewelyn. The side characters are badly written and poorly acted.
Even the <i>tagline</i> is stupid! ""<b>He's never been cooler.</b>"" Is that an ice pun? Not cool!

How does the James Bond franchise always manage to follow up trash with gold? I can't think of another series that so consistently comes back from terrible films. And now, after the disaster that was <i>Die Another Day</i> we get the best film in the series so far: <i>Casino Royale</i>.

Once again, Bond films do well when they use the series as a starting point to explore new themes and ideas, and <i>Casino Royale</i> does exactly that. As a sort of soft-reboot I'm not really sure how it fits into the timeline of the other movies (Is it a prequel where we see the origin of James Bond? If so why does it take place in the current year? Is it a complete reboot? If so, why is Judi Dench still M? Is Daniel Craig supposed to be a new person taking up the code name ""James Bond?"" If so, why does this show us the origins of some of the things he does in previous films?), so just don't think about it too much. The series takes a bold step in a new direction by showing us a new Bond: younger, unsure of himself, and vulnerable, both physically and emotionally. It's an origin story that fleshes out a character in desperate need for more depth. It's really exactly what the series needed.

Firstly, Daniel Craig. I wasn't sure about him at first, but he certainly showed me. His performance is excellent, portraying a much deeper version of the character than previous actors have. He can get wounded, and does repeatedly. He's inexperienced, and makes mistakes. Craig's Bond is also much more physically brutal than previous portrayals, which I certainly appreciate. He's probably the least ""fun"" Bond, but the more serious character fits the more serious tone of <i>Casino Royale</i> perfectly.

And the love interest: Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green. I like when Bond teams up with other MI6 agents, and it fits this story perfectly. Eva Green is an excellent Bond girl: beautiful, likable, and important to the plot. Eva Green's performance is great, contributing to a romance that actually unfolds naturally and has emotional weight to it. This is something that Bond films have only rarely succeeded at, so I'm glad to see it here.

Mads Mikkelsen plays a great villain, Le Chiffre, who manages to be both intimidating and vulnerable. Having his principle motivation be saving his own life creates an interesting dynamic.

As for side characters, they're mostly alright, but they mainly leave room for Bond, Vesper, and Le Chiffre to have the spotlight. Judi Dench is still fine as M, and Felix Leiter returns, this time played by Jeffrey Wright. Notably absent are Miss Moneypenny and Q, but honestly I don't mind. Samantha Bond and John Cleese were lackluster in their roles, and they're both not really necessary in this story.

I usually don't mention the openings in my reviews, because they're usually just good, and there isn't anything interesting to say about something that's just consistently good. But <i>Casino Royale</i>'s opening was really good, both the song and the animation. <i>Goldfinger</i> still has my favorite opening song, but this has my favorite opening visuals.

Now for the plot. I feel like I missed something, or maybe I'm just dumb, but I couldn't follow the plot of this. Why exactly did they need to beat Le Chiffre at the poker game? Why not just arrest him? Who was Mr. White? Was he the guy who killed Le Chiffre? The basic structure connecting scene to scene was simple enough, but it left a lot of unanswered questions (though maybe that was the point). Even at 144 minutes in length, <i>Casino Royale</i> seemed to fly by, and I was left with a feeling of ""that's it?"" at the end.

With the increased brutality the action scenes are a lot harder hitting. The opening parkour foot chase is really cool, and the airport scene was similarly intense. However, the action scenes get worse as the film goes on: the best one  is right at the beginning, and the final fight in the collapsing building in Venice is the weakest. Unfortunately a lot of the fist fights suffer from too many shaky closeups and quick cuts that are all too common in modern movies. There are also a instances of bad CGI, but nowhere near the level of <i>Die Another Day</i>.

<i>Casino Royale</i> proves once again that the James Bond franchise can be dark, complex, and serious, and can always come back even from what seem like the lowest of lows. It's a great film in its own right, and an excellent addition to the franchise.",007 marathon,2018-03-09

The woods at night are a great setting for a horror movie, Spooky noises and shadows moving in the branches can be really terrifying. I do wish we could have a horror movie about hikers who aren't dumbasses though. They go hiking in jeans, only have one map (which promptly gets lost), have one knife between four people, abandon their packs for no reason, drink muddy stagnant water, and don't even wear the backpacks properly. Despite their stupidity, I do like the characters though, they have actual personalities and realistic flaws, in contrast to the walking clichés of, say, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>. Rafe Spall's acting as our main character, Luke, is really good, and his emotional baggage adds a depth that most horror movies lack. The suspense is built naturally through good music and glimpses of the unnatural in the beginning.

You can't put the gun barrel opening at the end! Then it's a gun barrel closing, and that's not iconic at all! Why was it at the end anyway? Is this just the prequel to the real James Bond movie, which comes next? <i>Casino Royale</i> had a weird one, but at least it was near the beginning. And only 106 minutes in length? Bond movies are supposed to be 120-140 minutes. <i>Quantum of Solace</i> was shit though, so I'm not upset that it was over quickly.

The plot somehow manages to be simultaneously paper thin and astoundingly stupid. It could have been a cool espionage thriller about unraveling the international conspiracy that is SPECTRE, but instead it's about... I'm not really sure. M is mad at Bond for doing his job, so he's cut off from MI6 and out to get revenge on his own... again. It was a cool idea when <i>Licence to Kill</i> did it, but now it's like the third time it's happened and not getting any more interesting. The villain's master plan had something to do with buying up all the water in Bolivia, but I'm not really sure. I still don't even know what a ""quantum of solace"" is. It seems like they decided that the story isn't important as long as we have lots of action sequences, which brings me to the next issue.

Where did we go so astray in action scene directing? James Bond movies used to have really great action scenes, with amazing stunts, great practical effects, real destruction, and detailed miniature work. Most importantly, you could tell what the fuck was going on. Look at the climactic truck chase from <i>Licence to Kill</i>, that's a gold standard for action scenes in any movie, not just the Bond franchise. Now we get shit like <a href=""https://youtu.be/yfYC_CBNtiM"">this</a>. A million cuts per second, shaky cam up the ass, and bland, overused CGI. All the action scenes in <i>Quantum of Solace</i> are like that. There was a better skydiving sequence in <i>Moonraker</i> almost 30 years before this trash heap was released.

The new side characters are all garbage. The villain, energy CEO Dominic Greene, is not threatening at all, and comes off as more of a weird douchebag than a criminal mastermind. Love interest Camille Montea has no personality and is really just here because they needed a Bond girl.

The one glimmer of quality in this trainwreck is the returning characters. Daniel Craig is still great as Bond, his physicality and performance are both on point. Judi Dench is really good as M, with a much-appreciated larger role this time. Mathis returns from <i>Casino Royale</i>, and he's pretty good too. Oh yeah, the opening theme and title sequence were cool too.

I'm getting whiplash from these ratings. The past three films have alternated between garbage and gold, and the pendulum swings back toward quality for <i>Skyfall</i>, after the disaster that was <i>Quantum of Solace</i>.

Most of the Bond movies have had decent, but not noteworthy cinematography. <i>Skyfall</i> on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous, from the foggy Scottish countryside to the maze of glass, neon lights, and mirrors in a Shanghai highrise. Thanks Roger Deakins, I'm glad you finally got that Oscar.

The action scenes are also much better. You can generally tell what's going on, and there aren't a million cuts per second. There are still a few instances of dodgy CGI, but it's miles above <i>Quantum of Solace</i>. The rooftop chase and the final shootout are brilliantly executed, high quality action sequences.

As I've said before, Daniel Craig is great as Bond and Judi Dench plays a great M. This film fleshes out both of their backgrounds more, which is nice. Craig's Bond is starting to feel like a real human being, quite a change from some of the previous incarnations of the character.

The plot actually makes sense, hooray! Javier Bardem plays an interesting villain. Silva isn't my favorite Bond villain, but he's intimidating, smart, and definitely a worthy adversary for 007.

Overall, really solid Bond movie. There are a few things that bug me though. First of all, there's no real ""Bond girl."" I know it's not strictly required, but come on, sex appeal is one of the reasons people watch these movies. I also don't like the new Q, he can never live up to Desmond Llewelyn, and he's just kind of annoying. Also, his blatant disregard for cybersecurity despite being an alleged expert is infuriating. Why would you plug the laptop of a known hacker genius into your own network unprotected? That's really stupid!

Good, they put the gun barrel opening at the beginning this time. It seems the pendulum of quality continues to swing, but this time not very far to the bad side. <i>Spectre</i> seems to nicely wrap up the Daniel Craig era in a good, but perhaps overambitious, addition to the series.

I'll talk about the plot last for once. Let's start with the main cast. Daniel Craig is still great, and we get even more backstory on his character in this one. His is by far the Bond we know the most about, and that makes us care about him and what he's fighting for. He is starting to look old, but he still has that physical ferocity. Ralph Fiennes makes a good M, more similar to Bernard Lee's classic portrayal than the more modern Judi Dench. I like Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, but this Moneypenny has absolutely no relation to the original character. Ben Whishaw's Q is growing on me, but I still find him kind of annoying and cliched. The computer science in these films is so far removed from reality that it's best to just think of it as magic, and Q as a wizard. I actually really like Christoph Waltz as Blofeld. Blofeld isn't a great villain, and this isn't the best portrayal of the character (that would be Telly Savalas), but his cool, matter-of-fact personality makes him an enjoyable and threatening villain. Léa Seydoux is beautiful, but her character's personality doesn't make much sense. Her acting is decent, but she wasn't given a good role to work with.

The cinematography isn't as good as Roger Deakins's work in <i>Skyfall</i>, but it's still pretty nice. The opening four-minute long shot was amazing though (some of the hidden cuts are obvious, like the zoom in on the poster outside the hotel, but for other parts I have no idea how they did it).

The action sequences are quite good again, following the same style as <i>Skyfall</i>. The train fist fight with Dave Bautista (who plays a great henchman who I forget the name of) in particular stands out, with great choreography and really visceral impacts. The plane vs car scene was cool too, if kind of dumb (and I'll give them bonus points for having the perfect opportunity to include another ski chase and resisting it).

The main problem with <i>Spectre</i> is that it tries to do too much. It's the longest Bond film at 148 minutes in length, but parts of it still feel rushed. It's really about three different plots jammed into one movie. This film should have been about slowly starting to unravel the SPECTRE conspiracy, and the main villain should have been C. Blofeld could have been hinted at or maybe briefly introduced. The next film should have been about tracking down Blofeld and apprehending him. As it stands, the SPECTRE conspiracy comes apart too quickly, C dies like a bitch about three seconds after he's confronted, Bond blows up the SPECTRE compound about a minute after arriving, and it all feels way too rushed and incomplete. Also, the last three films have all had Bond be ""on his own"" without help from MI6, and that trope is wearing thin. I guess in the age of global surveillance everything would be too easy if he had the full support of the agency.

I do like the callbacks to the previous films. There are a lot of references to the Bond legacy, from the costumes to the settings to the plot. It evokes the same feeling of excitement and adventure as those early Bond films like <i>Dr. No</i> and <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>. I also like that they included a few jokes in the beginning. Thankfully the humor subsides when the plot gets serious, but the Craig era had been lacking the levity of the older films.

Overall, <i>Spectre</i> was overambitious and should have probably been two films instead, but it's still a worthy sequel and an enjoyable continuation of the franchise.

And that concludes my February James Bond Marathon. I'm finishing 10 days late, but it's been quite an enlightening experience.

2018-03-22,Predestination,2014,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/predestination/,3.5,"If you're interested in this movie, don't read anything about it before you watch it. When you have a movie about time travel, and one of the first events that happens in it is the protagonist getting extensive facial surgery to alter his appearance, it's practically screaming that there will be a twist ending. Despite this, it still took about 70 minutes before I realized what the twist would be.
Some of the acting and effects are cheesy, so it takes a little while to get into this film. The depiction of time travel and the set designs are really good though. The story is and writing are very tight, with almost zero excess information. Every line in every scene is absolutely vital to the story. It does hold the audience's hand a bit too much for my taste, but it's not too obnoxious about it most of the time. The camerawork is very nice, with a lot of interesting visual imagery that I won't get into for spoiler reasons.
Overall, <i>Predestination</i> is an excellent time travel movie, and it's fascinating to watch the story unfold and all the pieces fit together in the end.",,2018-03-21
2018-03-22,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/star-wars-the-last-jedi/,0.5,"I expected nothing and I was still disappointed. There isn't a single redeeming quality about this movie. At least <i>The Force Awakens</i> had a few instances of good cinematography and special effects, but <i>The Last Jedi</i> doesn't even have that. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single aspect of this movie is terrible. It's painfully obvious that no one involved in the production of this garbage cared about it. This is not a Star Wars film, it's a shitty cash grab pushed out by Disney. And I hope you're ready for a new one every single year for the rest of your life.

Why is tracking ships through hyperspace impossible all of a sudden? That's literally how the empire found the rebel base in the original <i>Star Wars</i>.
Why is the entire resistance like 20 people? This is a galaxy with trillions of people living it. Did the Republic not have a military for some reason?
Why couldn't the first order ships just hyperspace jump in front of the fleeing rebel ships?
Why was Holdo such a dick to Poe? She had no real reason not to tell him the plan. Even when he tries to stage a mutiny she still doesn't explain anything! It makes me think Holdo was just making it up as she went along.
How did Kylo Ren's scar magically change places between movies? Did the production crew really not give a shit?
When did Rey learn to swim?
Who the fuck is this guy Mark Hamill is playing? Because he's not Luke Skywalker. Even though Vader was responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people Luke never doubted that there was still good in him. He fought to the end to redeem Vader, and bring him back to the light. This guy sees one dark thought in a child's mind and tries to kill him.
If force ghosts can interact with the physical world, why have they never done it before? I can think of plenty of times when that would have been useful.
What was the point of the casino subplot? If there was a codebreaker on the ship already and they had removed the entire thing the movie wouldn't have lost anything of value.
Why did Holdo need to stay behind to pilot the cruiser? They have droids that are designed exclusively to pilot ships.
Why is hyperspace ramming a thing you can do? I thought passing too close to large objects pulled you out of hyperspace. Why did no one ever think of this before? Hyperspace missiles invalidate every other space battle.
Why didn't the First Order drop off the giant gun closer to the rebel base? Or drop bombs on the base from space?
How did Rose catch up with Finn after she had turned around? And why the fuck did she ""save"" him??
Even accepting that Luke can project a perfect image of himself across the galaxy somehow, why did doing so kill him?",,2018-03-21

From a technical standpoint it's unique and well-executed. The clever editing allows it to clearly convey a lot of information to the audience very rapidly. The music and sound design greatly enhance the emotional impact. It's a powerful film about a story that is unbelievably true.",,2018-03-21
2018-03-23,Mr. Nobody,2009,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/mr-nobody/,2,"<i>""Most of the time nothing happened. Like a French movie.""</i>

<i>Mr. Nobody</i> thinks it's smarter than it actually is. It has some interesting ideas, but but film itself is never interesting. This is mostly because Jared Leto stands up in front of the camera at the beginning of the movie and explains everything to you, complete with generic educational YouTube video-style editing. So the rest of the film is boring because you already know the trick. There really isn't any powerful, deeper meaning or revelation to be had, but <i>Mr. Nobody</i> goes on and on for two and a half hours as if there is.
There are a few cool moments, I like the soundtrack, and a lot of the imagery is good, but it's all pointless fluff. It's all just wrapped up in tons of pseudo-intellectual bullshit.",,2018-03-22
