I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip to be Square"", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.

Suggestions welcome.
