The horror elements were generally used well, but it leaves some questions about how everything worked. How did Aoyama know about how the girl was abused? She only told him in a hallucination sequence, not in real life (at least I think). Well directed, but a little too slow paced at times. Nice use of color.",,2017-06-07
2017-12-04,ADAM: The Mirror,2017,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/adam-the-mirror/,1.5,"The first episode was literally a tech demo. And it's not even a very impressive tech demo, it has the same visual fidelity as most modern video game cutscenes. Anyway, here's a sequel to a tech demo. It's not very good. Very cliche, and I can predict exactly where it's going to go. The robot designs are nice I guess, but that's about it. The rest of the world is bland and generic.

2017-12-04,ADAM: Chapter 3,2017,https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/film/adam-chapter-3/,1,"For a ""series"" that started as a tech demo, you would think that they would try to make the visuals actually look good. The textures, lighting, and modelling is are really bad, I think they're actually worse than the last one (although maybe the last one was just too dark to tell). We're three episodes in now and the plot somehow manages to both be incredibly cliche and make no sense at the same time.

I actually had to check to make sure it is stop-motion, and they didn't just cheat with CGI, but <a href=""http://animatorexpo.com/ochibisan/"">it is all real</a>. Nice music too.",japan animator expo,2018-01-16
