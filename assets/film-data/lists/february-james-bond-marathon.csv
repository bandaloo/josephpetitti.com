2018-01-07,February James Bond Marathon,"james bond, 007, february, yir2018, 007 marathon",https://letterboxd.com/jojonium/list/february-james-bond-marathon/,"I want to watch all the James Bond movies, since I haven't seen any of them. February is coming up. There are 26 films. February has 28 days. Close enough, one each day, and the last two days... I don't know, I'll figure something out.

EDIT: Well, February was a lot more busy than I expected, and I didn't end up finishing this until March 10. Oh well. Anyway, <a href=""https://boxd.it/1C46y"">here</a>'s my ranking of all the James Bond films."
