            <h1>Design Manifesto</h1>
			
			<h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
			<p>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the intersection of computer science and design. It uses aspects of art, science, and engineering to build computer systems that are powerful, intuitive, and pleasing to use. In CS 3041, I explored the basics of HCI through six design sprints that included everything from accessibility for the elderly to virtual reality game design.</p>

			<p>The class has helped me learn a lot about HCI in particular, but also about the design process in general. Each successive design sprint gave fewer specifics and more freedom, allowing gradually guiding students to find what design steps work best for them. I found these main points to be the most important across each project:</p>
			
			<h2>1. Brainstorming for the right solution</h2>

			</figure>
			
			<p>In Don Norman's "<a target="_blank" href="https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/reading/DesignThinking_DonNorman.pdf">The Design of Everyday Things</a>," the the first phase of the "Double-Diamond" model of design is actually finding the right <i>problem</i>. For the design sprints in CS 3041, we were usually given a clear problem to solve, allowing us to often skip this step. (However, in some of the later design sprints brainstorming for the right problem was necessary).</p>
			
			<p>For most of the projects, my design process began with brainstorming. As soon as the groups were assigned, I would meet with them and begin talking about what we wanted our solution to look like. In this step, group members would throw around ideas without concern for feasibility or practicality. The goal of brainstorming is simply to generate as many ideas as possible, in the hopes of finding one that will work.</p>
			
			<p>Often it was useful to make a quick sketch of an idea on paper, to visualize what it would look like. My groups would generate several pages worth of rough idea sketches, like the one shown below:</p>

            </figure>
			
			<p>The final product rarely ends up looking like the brainstorming sketches, but it's an important place to start.</p>
			
			<p>I also found that this step is often the hardest. As a computer science major, I'm good at strictly-defined constraints, and clear problem definitions. Being creative and coming up with new types of interactions, new visualizations, and entirely new constraints and problems is difficult for me. Fortunately, brainstorming in group settings has made the process much easier for me.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Do background research</h2>

                <figcaption>I reused the "change font size" button from medicare.gov (top), a website aimed at elderly users, in our Design for Others site (bottom), also designed for the elderly.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Find out what people actually want. There's no point in designing something that no one will want to use. As we learned in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/schedule.html#tue-313--need-finding--task-analysis">many need finding readings</a>, finding out what users want is important. Sending out surveys, asking classmates and friends, and researching how similar projects have been done were all techniques I used for background research.</p>
			
			<p>For <a href="https://medium.com/@tarrasque9/design-for-others-design-document-898e1c398f55" target="_blank">Design for Others</a>, my team was tasked with redesigning the Worcester Public Library's website for mobile, specifically for an elderly (70+ years old) audience. My team created a <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/VK3KOKVQBX4/">Mood Board</a> on Invision as a respository for ideas and images from other sites relevant to our project. As a part of my research, I saw what features other websites designed for elderly users did to be more accessible.</p>
			
			<p>One of the most useful features we included in our final site design was a button to make the font size bigger or smaller. From talking to elderly relatives about their experiences with mobile sites, I discovered that they often have trouble reading the text because it is too small. I looked at some other websites aimed at elderly users to see how they addressed this problem. I found that <a target="_blank" href="www.medicare.gov">medicare.gov</a>, has buttons on the top of the page to change the font size. I brought this idea to my group and we decided to implement it in our design.</p>
			
            <p>In our demo day feedback, the option to change font sizes was one of the most admired features, and we wou never have thought of it if not for the background research I did. It pays to do research.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Test the product thoroughly</h2>
            
            <p>I found from experience that testing the project before sending it to users is absolutely vital. Firstly, as with any computer science project the designs I made for the CS 3041 project were full of bugs and unintended side effects at first. Using the
